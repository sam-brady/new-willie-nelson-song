cruel cruel world must I go on
cruel cruel world I'm moving on
i've been living too fast
and I've been living too long
cruel cruel world I'm gone
[verse 1]
this big ol' world sure got me running 'round
i heard a voice that said "just settle down"
and with the moonlight as my guide
and with this feeling deep inside
i know now that I am homeward bound
cruel cruel world must I go on
cruel cruel world I'm moving on
i've been living too fast
and I've been living too long
cruel cruel world I'm gone
[guitar solo]
[verse 2]
desert roads desert plains
i have seen so much pain
now I see into the eyes of a girl
no more no more cruel world
cruel cruel world must I go on
cruel cruel world I'm moving on
i've been living too fast
and I've been living too long
cruel cruel world I'm gone
[guitar solo]
[verse 3]

on the road again -
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life I love is making music with my friends
and I can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again
goin' places that I've never been
seein' things that I may never see again
and I can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again -
like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
we're the best of friends
insisting that the world keep turning our way
and our way
is on the road again
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life I love is makin' music with my friends
and I can't wait to get on the road again
on the road again
like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
we're the best of friends
insisting that the world keep turning our way
and our way
is on the road again
just can't wait to get on the road again
the life I love is makin' music with my friends
and I can't wait to get on the road again
and I can't wait to get on the road again
when you lose the one you love
you think your world has ended
you think your world will be a waste of life
without them in it
you feel there's no way to go on
life is just a sad sad song
but love is bigger than us all
the end is not the end at all
it's not somethin' you get over
but it's somethin' you get through
it's not ours to be taken
it's just a thing we get to do
life goes on and on
and when it's gone
it lives in someone new
it's not somethin' you get over
but it's somethin' you get through
it's not somethin' you get over
but it's somethin' you get through
it's not ours to be taken
it's just a thing we get to do
life goes on and on
and when it's gone
it lives in someone new
it's not somethin' you get over
but it's somethin' you get through
it's not somethin' you get over
but it's somethin' you get through

[verse 1]
now many many years ago
when I was twenty three
i was married to a widow
who was pretty as could be
this widow had a grown-up daughter
had hair of red
my father fell in love with her
and soon the two were wed
this made my dad my son-in-law
and changed my very life
my daughter was my mother
because she was my father's wife
to complicate the matters
even though it brought me joy
i soon became the father
of a bouncing baby boy
my little baby then became
a brother-in-law to dad
and so became my uncle
though it made me very sad
for if he was my uncle
that also made him the brother
of the widow's grown-up daughter
who of course was my step-mother
i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
it sounds funny I know
but it really is so
i'm my own grandpa
[verse 2]
my father's wife then had a son
that kept them on the run
and he became my grandchild
for he was my daughter's son
my wife is now my mother's mother
and it makes me blue
because she is my wife
she's my grandmother too
i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
it sounds funny I know
but it really is so
i'm my own grandpa
[verse 3]
now if my wife is my grandmother
then I am her grandchild
and every time I think of it
it nearly drives me wild
for now I have become
the strangest case you ever saw
as the husband of my grandmother
i am my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
it sounds funny I know
but it really is so
i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
i'm my own grandpa
it sounds funny I know
but it really is so
i'm my own grandpa
in the twilight glow I see them
blue eyes crying in the rain
when we kissed goodbye and parted
i knew we'd never meet again
love is like a dying ember
and only memories remain
and through the ages I'll remember
blue eyes crying in the rain
some day when we meet up yonder
we'll stroll hand-in-hand again
in a land that knows no parting
blue eyes crying in the rain
now my hair has turned to silver
all my life I've loved in vain
i can see her star in heaven
blue eyes crying in the rain
[verse 1]
maybe I didn't love you
quite as often as I could have
maybe I didn't treat you
quite as good as I should have
if I made you feel second best
girl I'm sorry I was blind
you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
[verse 2]
and maybe I didn't hold you
all those lonely lonely times
and I guess I never told you
i'm so happy that you're mine
little things I should have said and done
i just never took the time
and you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
tell me tell me that your
sweet love hasn't died
and give me
give me one more chance
to keep you satisfied
keep you satisfied
little things I should have said and done
i just never took the time
but you were always on my mind
you were always on my mind
[verse 1]
at a time when the world seems to be spinnin'
hopelessly out of control
there's deceivers and believers and old in-betweeners
that seem to have no place to go
well it's the same old song it's right and it's wrong
and living is just something that I do
and with no place to hide I looked in your eyes
and I found myself in you
i looked to the stars
tried all of the bars
and I've nearly gone up in smoke
now my hand's on the wheel
i've something that's real
and I feel like I'm going home
[verse 2]
and in the shade of an oak down by the river
sat an old man and a boy
setting sail spinning tales and fishing for whales
with a lady they both enjoy
well it's the same damn tune
it's the man in the moon
it's the way that I feel about you
and with no place to hide
i looked in your eyes
and I found myself in you
and I looked to the stars
tried all of the bars
and I've nearly gone up in smoke
now my hand's on the wheel
i've something that's real
and I feel like I'm going home
[verse 1 ray charles]
he looked down into her brown eyes
and said "say a prayer for me"
she threw her arms around him
whispered "god will keep us free"
they could hear the riders coming
he said "this is my last fight
if they take me back to texas
they won't take me back alive"
[chorus ray charles]
there were seven spanish angels
at the altar of the sun
they were praying for the lovers
in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels
took another angel home
[verse 2 willie nelson]
she reached down and picked the gun up
that lay smoking in his hand
she said "father please forgive me
i can't make it without my man"
and she knew the gun was empty
and she knew she couldn't win
her final prayer was answered
when the rifles fired again
[chorus willie nelson]
there were seven spanish angels
at the altar of the sun
they were praying for the lovers
in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels
took another angel home
[chorus ray charles]
there were seven spanish angels
at the alter of the sun
they were praying for the lovers
in the valley of the gun
when the battle stopped
and the smoke cleared
there was thunder from the throne
and seven spanish angels
took another angel home
[interlude ray charles]
come on willie help me with this thing
[chorus both]
there were seven spanish angels
at the altar of the sun oh I believe
they were praying for the lovers yeah they was
in the valley of the gun well well well
when the battle stopped and the smoke cleared
there was thunder from the throne oh yeah
and seven spanish angels
took another angel home
[verse 1]
the red-headed stranger from blue rock montana
rode into town one day
and under his knees was a raging black stallion
and walking behind was a bay
the red-headed stranger had eyes like thunder
and his lips they were sad and tight
his little lost love lay asleep on the hillside
and his heart was heavy as night
don't cross him don't boss him
he's wild in his sorrow
he's riding and hiding his pain
don't fight him don't spite him
just wait 'til tomorrow
maybe he'll ride on again
[verse 2]
a yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
and watched as he passed her way
she drew back in fear at the sight of the stallion
but cast greedy eyes on the bay
but how could she know that this dancing bay pony
meant more to him than life
for this was the horse that his little lost darling
had ridden when she was his wife
don't cross him don't boss him
he's wild in his sorrow
he's riding and hiding his pain
don't fight him don't spite him
just wait till tomorrow
maybe he'll ride on again
[verse 3]
the yellow-haired lady came down to the tavern
and looked up the stranger there
he bought her a drink and he gave her some money
he just didn't seem to care
she followed him out as he saddled his stallion
and laughed as she grabbed at the bay
he shot her so quick they had no time to warn her
she never heard anyone say
"don't cross him don't boss him
"he's wild in his sorrow
"he's riding and hiding his pain
"don't fight him don't spite him
"just wait 'til tomorrow
"maybe he'll ride on again"
[verse 4]
the yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
the stranger went free of course
for you can't hang a man for killing a woman
who's trying to steal your horse
this is the tale of the red headed stranger
and if he should pass your way
stay out of the path of the raging black stallion
and don't lay a hand on the bay
don't cross him don't boss him
he's wild in his sorrow
he's riding and hiding his pain
don't fight him don't spite him
just wait till tomorrow
maybe he'll ride on again

sometimes I wonder why I spend
the lonely nights dreaming of a song
the melody haunts my reverie
and I am once again with you
when our love was new
and each kiss an inspiration
but that was long ago
and now my consolation is in the stardust of a song
beside the garden wall when stars are bright
you are in my arms
the nightingale tells his fairy tale
a paradise where roses bloom
though I dream in vain
in my heart there always will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love's refrain
though I dream in vain
in my heart there always will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love's refrain
though I dream in vain
in my heart there always will remain
my stardust melody
the memory of love's refrain
oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
don't fence me in
let me ride through the wide open country that I love
don't fence me in
let me be by myself in the evening breeze
listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees
oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
don't fence me in
let me ride through the wide open country that I love
don't fence me in
just turn me loose let me straddle my old saddle
underneath the western skies
on my cayuse let me wander over yonder
'till I see the mountains rise
i want to ride to the ridge where the west commences
gaze at the moon until I lose my senses
oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above
don't fence me in
let me ride through the wide open country that I love
don't fence me in
[verse 1]
i turned the sound down on my tv
i just can't listen any more
it's like I'm in some foreign country
that I've never seen before
so come now here to think about it
what in the hell are we goin to do
cause after all is said and all is done
it's just me and you
it's just me and you
and we are definitely outnumbered
there's more of them than us
just when you think you made a new friend
they throw you under the bus
so it's just me and you
it's just me and you
[verse 2]
i had a friend I used to talk to
we used to both sit on the fence
but anymore I can't relate to him
'cause he ain't got a lick of sense
so now I just ask you the questions
but I'm the one I'm talkin' to
the world has gone out of its mind
except for me and you
it's just me and you
and we are definitely outnumbered
there's more of them than us
just when you think you made a new friend
they throw you under the bus
so it's just me and you
it's just me and you
yeah it's just me and you
blue skies smiling at me
nothing but blue skies do I see
blue birds singing a song
nothing but blue skies from now on
i never saw the sun shining so bright
never saw things going so right
noticing the days hurrying by
when you're in love my how they fly by
blue days all of them gone
nothing but blue skies from now on
blue skies smiling at me
nothing but blue skies do I see
blue days all of them gone
nothing but blue skies from now on
blue skies smiling at me
nothing but blue skies do I see
blue days all of them gone
nothing but blue skies from now on
blue skies smiling at me
nothing but blue skies do I see
blue days all of them gone
nothing but blue skies from now on

it's been rough and rocky traveling
but I'm finally standing upright on the ground
after taking several readings
i'm surprised to find my mind's still fairly sound
[chorus-willie nelson]

almost busted in laredo
but for reasons that I'd rather not disclose
but if you're staying in a motel there and leave
just don't leave nothing in your clothes

they said we looked suspicious
but I believe they like to pick on me and paul

it was the time of the preacher
when the story began
with the choice of a lady
and the love of a man
how he loved her so dearly
he went out of his mind
when she left him for someone
that she'd left behind
he cried like a baby
he screamed like a panther
in the middle of the night
and he saddled his pony
he went for a ride
it was the time of the preacher
in the year of '01
now the preachin' is over
and the lesson's begun

they say my pace would kill a normal man
but I've never been accused of being normal anyway
and I woke up still not dead again today

but at ten I woke up with a two
[verse 2]
well I made up my mind I was never gonna find
myself in that condition again
but here I sit on the same bar stool
and just look at the shape that I'm in
i done spotted me another queen
sittin' at a table alone
so I strolled on over and sat myself down
and asked if I can take her home
when she said yes I thought I'd been blessed
but boy did I look like a fool
last night I came in at two with a ten
but at ten I woke up with a ten
last night I came in at two with a ten
but at ten I woke up with a two
i've got 20/20 vision when I ain't drinking
but lord when I get on that booze
i ain't never gone to bed with an uglier woman
but I sure woke up with a few
last night I came in at two with a ten
but at ten I woke up with a two
now you may laugh
but if you've got the cash
i'll bet you ten to one you have too
well there's many a strange impulse out on the plains of west texas
there's many a young boy who feels things he can't comprehend
and a small town don't like it when somebody falls between sexes
no a small town don't like it when a cowboy has feelings for men
and I believe to my soul that inside every man there's the feminine
and inside every lady there's a deep manly voice loud and clear
well a cowboy may brag about things that he's done with his women
but the ones who brag loudest are the ones that are most likely queer
cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
say what do you think all them saddles and boots was about
and there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
and inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out
and there's always somebody who says what the others just whisper
and mostly that someone's the first one to get shot down dead
so when you talk to a cowboy don't treat him like he was a sister
you can't fuck with a lady that's sleepin' in each cowboy's head
cowboys are frequently secretly fond of each other
what did you think all them saddles and boots was about
and there's many a cowboy who don't understand the way that he feels for his brother
and inside every lady there's a cowboy who wants to come out
and inside every cowboy there's a lady that'd love to slip out
if you had not have fallen
then I would not have found you
angel flying too close to the ground
and I patched up your broken wing and hung around a while
trying to keep your spirits up and your fever down
i knew someday that you would fly away
for love's the greatest healer to be found
so leave me if you need to I will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
fly on fly on past the speed of sound
i'd rather see you up than see you down
so leave me if you need to I will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
leave me if you need to I will still remember
angel flying too close to the ground
oh lord it's hard to be humble
when you're perfect in every way
i can't wait to look in the mirror
'cause I get better lookin' each day
to know me is to love me
i must be a hell of a man
oh lord it's hard to be humble
but I'm doin' the best that I can
[verse 1]
i used to have me a girlfriend
but I guess that she couldn't compete
with all of them love-starved women
who keep clamoring around at my feet
well I probably could find me another
but I guess they're all in awe of me oh man
who cares I'll never get lonesome
'cause I treasure my own company
oh lord it's hard to be humble
when you're perfect in every way
i can't wait to look in the mirror
'cause I get better lookin' each day
to know me is to love me
i must be one hell of a man
oh lord it's hard to be humble
but I'm doin' the best that we can
[verse 2]
i guess you could say I'm a loner yeah
a cowboy outlaw tough and proud
i could have a lot of friends if I wanted
but then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
some folks say that I'm egotistical
hell I don't even know what that means
i guess it has something to do with the way
that I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans
oh lord it's hard to be humble
when you're perfect in every way
i can't wait to look in the mirror
but I get better lookin' each day
to know me is to love me
i must be one hell of a man
oh lord it's hard to be humble
but I'm doin' the best that we can
lord it's hard to be humble
but I'm doin' the best that I can
you're my buddy my pal my friend
it will be that way until the end
and wherever you go I want you to know
you're my buddy my pal my friend
[verse 2]
and I've loved you all over the world
you are my sunshine
you keep my life in a whirl
and you love me sometimes
i'll always follow my heart
wherever it takes me
and until death do us part
i'll love you all over the world
[instrumental break]
i'll always follow my heart
wherever it takes me
and until death do us part
i'll love you all over the world
[instrumental outro]
[verse 1]
oh ellis island was swarming
like a scene from a costume ball
decked out in the colors of europe
and on fire with the hope of it all
there my father's own father stood huddled
with the tired and hungry and scared
turn of the century pilgrims
bound by the dream that they shared
they were standing in line just like cattle
poked and sorted and shoved
some were one desk away from sweet freedom
some were torn from someone they love
through this sprawling tower of babel
came a young man confused and alone
determined and bound for america
and carrying all that he owned
sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
i saw that day reflected and I couldn't hold my feelings inside
i saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"so don't take it for granted" said grandfather's immigrant eyes
[verse 2]
he would rock and stare out the window
but his eyes are still just as clear
as the day he sailed through the harbor
and come ashore on that island of tears
my grandfather's days were numbered
but I won't let his memory die
'cause he gave me the gift of this country
and the look in his immigrant eyes
sometimes when I looked in my grandfather's immigrant eyes
i saw that day reflected and couldn't hold my feelings inside
i saw started with nothing and working hard all of his life
"so don't take it for granted" said grandfather's immigrant eyes
"don't take it for granted" said grandfather's immigrant eyes
a woman's love goes deeper than a man's
into a place only she understands
it's a healing touch it's a blade of a knife
but it's a woman's love a woman's love that gives you life
a woman's love is stronger than a man's
but it can hold your heart in the palm of its hands
it'll keep the faith through the long dark night
it takes a woman's love a woman's love to see the light
it'll make you fly or sink you like a stone
it'll leave you high or leave you all alone
if you believe her word no matter what you've heard
anybody say about it there's no life for you without it now
it'll make you fly or sink you like a stone
but it'll leave you high or leave you all alone
if you believe her word no matter what you've heard
anybody say about it there's no life for you without it now
if a woman's love ever finds your soul
it'll break your will and take control
cause the very thing that your heart cries for
is a woman's love this woman's love and nothing more
it's a woman love you're living for
[verse 1]
well hello there
my it's been a long long time
how am I doing
oh I guess that I'm doing fine
it's been so long now
but it seems now that it was only yesterday
gee ain't it funny how time slips away
[verse 2]
how's your new love
i hope that he's doing fine
i heard you told him
that you'd love him 'til the end of time
now that's the same thing that you told me
seems like just the other day
gee ain't it funny how time slips away
[verse 3]
i got to go now
i guess I'll see you around
don't know when though
never know when I'll be back in town
but remember what I tell you
in time you're gonna pay
and it's surprising how time slips away
[verse 1]
we rode into battle barebacked and saddled
you took the wound in your side
you pulled the sleds and you pulled the wagons
you gave 'em somewhere to hide
now they don’t need you and there's no one to feed you
and there's fences where you used to roam
i wish I could gather up all of your brothers
and you would just ride me back home
ride me back home to a much better place
blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
somewhere where they would just leave you alone
somewhere that you could call home
and you would just ride me back home
[verse 2]
i got a small place up in the foothills
where green grass is precious as gold
i paid a fortune for what little I got here
but you know that i’d sell my soul
to have all the mountains the rivers and valleys
the places where you need to roam
i would just gather up all of your brothers
and you would just ride me back home
ride me back home to a much better place
blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
somewhere where they would just leave you alone
somewhere that you could call home
and you would just ride me back home
ride me back home to a much better place
blue skies and sunshine and plenty of space
somewhere where they would just leave you alone
somewhere that you could call home
and you would just ride me back home
can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
it's so cold lying here all alone
and I have no hold to hold on you
and I assure you I'll do you no wrong
don't know why but the one I love left me
left me lonely and cold and so weak
and I need someone's arms to hold me
'til I'm strong enough to get back on my feet
can I sleep in your arms
can I sleep in your arms
can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
it's so cold lying here all alone
and I have no hold to hold on you and
i assure you I'll do you no wrong
can I sleep in your arms tonight lady
it's so cold lying here all alone
and I have no hold to hold on you and
i assure you I'll do you no wrong

and in the midst of the laughter he cries

and that hell treats us both just the same

the postman delivered
a "past due" bill notice
the alarm clock rang two hours late
the garbage man left all the trash
on the sidewalk
and the hinges fell off of the gate
and this morning at breakfast
i spilled all the coffee
and I opened the door on my knee
but the last thing I needed
the first thing this morning
was to have you walk out on me
[verse 1]
last night you came home late
and I knew you'd been drinking
by that old mellow look on your face
i thought "it don't matter
because it's the holiday season"
and you fill such a big empty space
but then I laid down beside you
and I wanted your loving
because your love makes my life complete
but the last thing I needed
the first thing this morning
was to have you walk out on me
[verse 2]
so excuse me for looking
like my world just ended
and excuse me for looking
like I just lost my best friend
and excuse me for living
and being forgiving
so just go on if you want to be free
but the last thing I needed
the first thing this morning
was to have you walk out on me
[verse 1]
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
[verse 2]
when the blazing sun is gone
when he nothing shines upon
then you show your little light
twinkle twinkle all the night
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
[verse 3]
then the traveler in the dark
thanks you for your tiny spark
he could not see which way to go
if you did not twinkle so
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
[verse 4]
in the dark blue sky you keep
while you throw my window peep
and you never shut your eye
till the sun is in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how I wonder what you are
[verse 1]
take the ribbon from your hair
shake it loose and let it fall
playing soft against your skin
like the shadows on the wall
come and lay down by my side
till the early morning light
all I'm taking is your time
help me make it through the night
i don't care if it's right or wrong
i don't try to understand
let the devil take tomorrow
because tonight I need a friend
yesterday is dead and gone
and tomorrow's out of sight
and it's sad to be alone
help me make it through the night
[vere 2]
i don't care if it's right or wrong

help me make it through the night
i don't want to be alone
help me make it through the night

look around you
look down the bar from you
the lonely faces that you see
are you sure that this is where you want to be
[verse 2]
these are your friends
but are they real friends
do they love you as much as me
are you sure that this is where you want to be
[verse 3]
please don't let my tears persuade you
i had hoped I wouldn't cry
but lately teardrops seem a part of me
so look around you and take a good look
and just between you and me
are you sure that this is where you want to be
this ole house once knew his children
this ole house once knew his wife
this ole house was home and comfort
as they fought the storms of life
this old house once rang with laughter
this old house heard many shouts
now he trembles in the darkness
when the lightnin' walks about

ain't a-gonna need this house no more
ain't got time to fix the shingles
ain't got time to fix the floor
ain't got time to oil the hinges
nor to mend the windowpane

this ole house is a-gettin' shaky
this ole house is a-gettin' old
this ole house lets in the rain

my favorite picture of you
is the one where you're staring
straight into the lens
it's just a polaroid shot
someone took on the spot
no beginning no end
just a moment in time that you can't have back
you never left but your bags were packed
just in case
[verse 2]
my favorite picture of you
is bent and it's faded
and it's pinned to my wall
oh and you were so angry
that it's hard to believe
that we were lovers at all
there's a fire in your eyes your heart's on your sleeve
a curse on your lips but all I can see is beautiful
[verse 3]
my favorite picture of you
is the one where
your wings are showing
and your arms are crossed
and your fists are clenched
not gone but going
a stand-up angel who won't back down
nobody's fool and nobody's clown
you were smarter than that
[verse 4]
my favorite picture of you
is the one where
it hasn't rained yet
and as I recall
there came a winter squall
and we got soaking wet
a thousand words in the blink of an eye
the camera loves you and so do i
my favorite picture of you
is the one where you're staring
straight into the lens
well he rode into blue rock dusty and tired
and he got him a room for the night
he lay there in silence with too much on his mind
still hoping that he was not right
but he found them that evening at a tavern in town
in a quiet little out-of-the-way place
and they smiled at each other when he walked through the door
and they died with their smiles on their faces
they died with a smile on their face
don't boss him don't cross him he's wild in his sorrow
he's riding and hiding his pain
don't fight him don't spite him just wait 'til tomorrow
maybe he'll ride on again
[verse 1]
riding on the city of new orleans
illinois central monday morning rail
fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders
three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail
all along the southbound odyssey
the train pulls out of kankakee
and rolls along past houses farms and fields
passing trains that have no name
and freight-yards full of old black men
and graveyards full of rusted automobiles
good morning america how are you
say don't you know me I'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
and I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
[verse 2]
dealing cards with an old man in the club car
penny a point ain't no one keeping score
pass that paper bag that holds the bottle
and feel the wheels rumbling beneath the floor
and the sons of pullman porters and the sons of engineers
ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel
mothers with their babes asleep rocking to that gentle beat
and the rhythm of the rails is all they feel
good morning america how are you
say don't you know me I'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
and I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
[verse 3]
night time on the city of new orleans
changing cars in memphis tennessee
half way home we'll be there by morning
through the mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea
but all the towns and people seem to fade into a bad dream
and the steel rails still ain't heard the news
the conductor sings his songs again
the passengers will please refrain
this train has got the disappearing railroad blues
good morning america how are you
say don't you know me I'm your native son
i'm the train they call the city of new orleans
and I'll be gone five hundred miles when the day is done
[verse 1]
we were headed home in austin
caught pneumonia on the road
taking it home to connie and the kids
a wheel ran off and jumped a railroad
then ran through a grocery store
[verse 2]
if you want to buy a bus I'm taking bids
and the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
he said traveling on the road is such a drag
if we can make it home by friday we can brag
and the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
[verse 3]
well I just got back from new york city
kris and rita done it all
raw perfection there for all the world to see
lord I heard an angel singing
in the philharmonic hall
rita coolidge rita coolidge cleft for me
and the devil shivered
and the devil shivered in his sleeping bag
[verse 1]
well last night I came home and I knocked on my door
and I called to my love as I oft' had before
and I knocked and I knocked no answer there came
no kisses to greet me no voice called my name
and I couldn't believe it was true oh lord
couldn't believe it was true
and my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
and I couldn't believe it was true
[verse 2]
well the shock was so great I am quivering yet
and I'll try to forgive but I cannot forget
my heart breaking loss is another man's gain
her happiness always I hope will remain
and I couldn't believe it was true oh lord
couldn't believe it was true
and my eyes filled with tears and I must've aged ten years
and I couldn't believe it was true
[verse 1]
come up to meet you tell you I'm sorry
you don't know how lovely you are
i had to find you
tell you I need you
tell you I set you apart
tell me your secrets
and ask me your questions
oh let's go back to the start
running in circles
coming up tails
heads on a science apart
nobody said it was easy
it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start
[verse 2]
i was just guessing
at numbers and figures
pulling the puzzles apart
questions of science
science and progress
don't speak as loud as my heart
tell me you love me
come back and haunt me
oh and I rush to the start
running in circles
chasing tails
coming back as we are
nobody said it was easy
it's such a shame for us to part
nobody said it was easy
no one ever said it would be this hard
oh take me back to the start
[verse 1]
i'm writing a song all about you
a true song as real as my tears
but you've no need to fear it
'cause no one will hear it
'cause sad songs and waltzes

[verse 2]
i'll tell all about how you cheated
i'd like for the whole world to hear
i'd like to get even with you
'cause you're leaving

oh that's my saddle horn - thank goodness
i followed you to hell and back
i'll follow you again
no matter where you take me
it's some place that I ain't been
and I'll go to hell believing
true love you're still my friend
from the start to the finish
and until the bitter end
i'll live my life believing
true love you're still my friend
the whole damn thing is over
and we reach our journey's end
i'll leave this world believing
true love you're still my friend
the road was always rocky
trouble waitin' 'round every bend
i'll go to hell believing
true love you're still my friend
you taught me how to twist and turn
and bend before I break
and fake it till I make it
all for true love's sake
you're worth all the heartaches
and I'd do it all again
i'll leave this world believing
true love you're still my friend
when the whole damn thing is over
never to be again
i'll go to hell believing
true love you're still my friend
i can't escape this prison
this cell I'm living in
where memories guard the inmates
and true love you're still my friend
grab your coat and get your hat
leave your worry on the doorstep
just direct your feet
to the sunny side of the street
can't you hear a petter pat
and that happy tune is your step
life can be so sweet
on the sunny side of the street
i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but I'm not afraid
this rover crossed over
if I never have a cent
i'll be rich as rockefeller
gold dust at my feet
on the sunny side of the street
i used to walk in the shade
with those blues on parade
but I'm not afraid
this rover crossed over
if I never have a cent
i'll be rich as rockefeller
gold dust at my feet
on the sunny side of the street
[verse 1]
you told me once that you were mine alone forever
and I was yours 'til the end of eternity
but all those vows are broken now and I will never
be the same except in memory
remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
remember me at the close of a long long day
and it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
just to know you still remember me
[verse 2]
a brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
another love with a heart more bold and free
but in the end fair-weather friends may break your heart dear
and if they do sweetheart remember me
remember me when the candle lights are gleaming
remember me at the close of a long long day
it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreaming
just to know you still remember me
just to know you still remember me
[verse 1]
don't ever complain about nothin'
before we can walk we all gotta crawl
halitosis is a word I never could spell
but bad breath is better than no breath at all
[verse 2]
it's okay to say "hello" to me
but don't get too near if you don't wanna fall
and don't think you'll love me if my breath melts the wall
'cause bad breath is better than no breath at all
i've been a-puffin' on this and a-suckin' on that
i got feelin' a thousand feet tall
the closer we get you'll have to agree
that bad breath is better than no breath at all
[verse 3]
i been talkin' to the man in the mirror
and he smells his diet is rot-gut alcohol
but it's better I guess than starvin' to death
and bad breath is better than no breath at all
i've been a-puffin' on this and a-suckin' on that
i'm feelin' a thousand feet tall
the closer we get you'll have to agree
that bad breath is better than no breath at all
yeah bad breath is better than no breath at all
[verse 1]
you have all read the beautiful stories
of the countries far over the sea
from whence came our ancestors
to establish this land of the free
[verse 2]
there are some folks who still like to travel
to see what they have over there
but when they go look it's not like the book
and they find there is none to compare
to beautiful beautiful texas
where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
we're proud of our forefathers
who fought at the alamo
you can live on the plains or the mountains
or down where the sea breezes blow
and you're still in beautiful texas
the most beautiful place that I know
[verse 3]
you can travel on beautiful highways
by the cities the village the farms
or fly above on the skyways
and the beauty below you will charm
[verse 4]
white cotton green pastures blue rivers
golden wheat fields and fruit trees that bear
you can look till doomsday and then you will say
that texas has beauty to spare
beautiful beautiful texas
where the beautiful bluebonnets grow
we're proud of our forefathers
who fought at the alamo
you can live on the plains or the mountains
or down where the sea breezes blow
and you're still in beautiful texas
the most beautiful place that I know
and you're still in beautiful texas
the most beautiful place that I know
but he could not forgive her
though he tried and tried and tried
and the halls of his memory
still echo her lies
and he cried like a baby
and he screamed like a panther in the middle of the night
and he saddled his pony
and he went for a ride
it was the time of the preacher
in the year of '01
now the lesson is over
and the killin's begun
somewhere over the rainbow
way up high
there's a land that I heard of
once in a lullaby
somewhere over the rainbow
skies are blue
and the dreams that you dare to dream
really do come true
some day I'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemondrops
away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me
somewhere over the rainbow
bluebirds fly
birds fly over the rainbow
why then oh why can't i
some day I'll wish upon a star
and wake up where the clouds are far behind me
where troubles melt like lemondrops
away above the chimney tops
that's where you'll find me
somewhere over the rainbow
bluebirds fly
birds fly over the rainbow
why then oh why can't i
if happy little bluebirds fly
beyond the rainbow
why oh why can't i
[verse 1]
when we dance together my world's in disguise
it's a fairy-land tale that's come true
and when you look at me with those stars in your eyes
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms
waltz across texas with you
like a story-book ending I'm lost in your charms
and I could waltz across texas with you
[verse 2]
my heartaches and troubles are just up and gone
the moment that you come in view
and with your hand in mine dear I could dance all night long
i could waltz across texas with you
waltz across texas with you in my arms
waltz across texas with you
like a story-book ending I'm lost in your charms
and I could waltz across texas with you
[verse 1]
there's a family bible on the table
it's pages worn and hard to read
but the family bible on the table
will ever be my key to memories
[verse 2]
at the end of day when work was over
and when the evening meal was done
dad would read to us from the family bible
and we'd count our many blessings one by one
i can see us sitting 'round the table
when from the family bible dad would read
and I can hear my mother softly singing
rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
[verse 3]
now this old world of ours is full of trouble
this old world would also better be
if we found more bibles on the table
and mothers singing rock of ages cleft for me
i can see us sitting 'round the table
when from the family bible dad would read
and I can hear my mother softly singing
rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
rock of ages rock of ages cleft for me
[verse 1]

someone told me long ago there's a calm before the storm
i know it's been coming for some time
when it's over so they say it'll rain a sunny day
i know shining down like water
i want to know have you ever seen the rain
i want to know have you ever seen the rain
coming down on a sunny day
[verse 2]
yesterday and days before sun is cold and rain is hard
i know been that way for all my time
'til forever on it goes through the circle fast and slow
i know it can't stop I wonder
i want to know have you ever seen the rain

coming down on a sunny day

the whole day through
an' just an old sweet song
keeps georgia on my mind
georgia georgia
a song of you
comes as sweet and clear
as moonlight through the pines
other arms reach out to me
other eyes smile tenderly
still in peaceful dreams I see
the road leads back to you

no peace I find
just an old sweet song
keeps georgia on my mind

have I told you lately that I love you
could I tell you once again somehow
have I told you how with all my heart and soul I need you
well darling I'm telling you now
my heart would break in two if I should lose you I'm no good without you anyhow
have I told you lately that I love you
well darling I'm telling you now
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
every dream that I dream is you somehow
and have I told you how my every thought is in your keeping
well darling I'm telling you now
my world would end today if I should lose you
because I'm no good without you anyhow
have I told you lately that I love you
well darling I'm telling you now
i know you won't believe these things I tell you
no you won't believe
your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
and your mind cannot conceive
now all depends on what I say to you
and on your doubting me
so I've prepared these statements far from true
pay heed and disbelieve
the sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
and the sky was never blue
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
and I never cared for you
[instrumental break]
the sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
and the sky was never blue

got the news this morning
it would be a tough day
someone's so much larger than life
can't believe he could pass away
when it comes to country music he's the world
and it wouldn't be all it is without merle
and he won't ever be gone
his songs live on
a fugutive and a brand new man
mama tried to understand
left us a lifetime of songs
and he won't ever be gone
we were friends right from the start
and we shared some high times
i would sing some songs he wrote
and he would sing a few of my own
music made us brothers 'til the end
not a day goes by that I don't miss him
and he won't ever be gone
his songs live on
ramblin' fever and the way I am
blue collar blues for the working man
we'll be singin it back home from now on
and he won't ever be gone
and he won't ever be gone
his songs live on
a fugutive and a brand new man
mama tried to understand
left us a lifetime of songs
and he won't ever be gone
we'll be singin it back home from now on
and he won't ever be gone
turn out the lights the party's over
they say that all good things must end
call it a night the party's over
and tomorrow starts the same old thing again
[verse 1]
what a crazy crazy party never seen so many people
laughing dancing look at you you're having fun
but look at me I'm almost crying
but that don't keep her love from dying
misery 'cause for me the party's over
turn out the lights the party's over
they say that all good things must end
call it a night the party's over
and tomorrow starts the same old thing again
[verse 2]
once I had a love undying I didn't keep it wasn't trying
life for me was just one party and then another
i broke her heart so many times had to have my party wife
and then one night she said "sweetheart the party's over"
turn out the lights the party's over
they say that all good things must end
call it a night the party's over
and tomorrow starts the same old thing again
and tomorrow starts the same old thing again
i grew up a-dreamin' of bein' a cowboy
and lovin' the cowboy ways
pursuin' the life of my high-ridin' heroes
i burned up my childhood days
i learned of all the rules of the modern-day drifter
don't you hold on to nothin' too long
just take what you need from the ladies then leave them
with the words of a sad country song
my heroes have always been cowboys
and they still are it seems
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
cowboys are special with their own brand of misery
from being alone too long
you could die from the cold in the arms of a nightmare
knowin' well that your best days are gone
pickin' up hookers instead of my pen
i let the words of my years fade away
old worn-out saddles and old worn-out memories
with no one and no place to stay
my heroes have always been cowboys
and they still are it seems
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
sadly in search of but one step in back of
themselves and their slow-movin' dreams
[verse 1]
woke up this morning with the sundown shining in
found my mind in a brown paper bag again
tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
tore my mind on a jagged sky
and I just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
lord lord lord what condition my condition was in
[verse 2]
i pushed my soul in a deep dark hole and followed it in
met myself crawling out as I was crawling in
i woke up so tight I said I'd never unwind
i saw so much that it broke my mind
i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
lord lord lord what condition my condition was in
i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
lord lord lord what condition my condition was in
[verse 3]
somebody painted april fool in big black letters
on a dead end sign
i had my foot on the gas
when I left the road it blew out my mind
eight miles out of memphis lord I got no spare
eight miles straight up downtown somewhere
i just dropped in to see what condition my condition was in
lord lord lord what condition my condition was in
what condition my condition was in

i been sittin' around countin' my blessings
thinkin' of friends here and gone
recallin' the smile across somebody's face
whenever I'd sing her a song
the good book says "love everybody"
and the lord knows I really have tried
so I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I have missed
and I'll try to do better next time
[verse 2]
by next time I might be a preacher
or an eagle gliding away
i hope that my spirit will make someone happy
when I'm gone to come back again
the good book says "love everybody"
and the lord knows I really have tried
so I'll throw a kiss to the ones that I have missed
and I'll try to do better next time

if you're feeling salty I'm your tequila
if you've got the freedom well I've got the time
there is nothing sweeter than naked emotions
so you show me yours fun and I'll show you mine
no mam I know this isn't all that you've ever been used to
you with your rings of your fingers and time on your hands
sometimes it's nice to have somebody nice to be close to
god knows I've been there before you and I understand
if you're feeling salty[]
i wish that I were the answer to all of your questions
lord knows I know you wish you were the answer to mine
so darling if you haven't got a thing but a change of direction
lord knows I know you'll be something I'm lucky to find
if you're feeling salty[]
if you show me yours fun and I'll show you mine
the bright lights of denver are shining like diamonds
like ten thousand jewels in the sky
and it's nobody's business where you're going or where you come from
and you're judged by the look in your eye
she saw him that evening in a tavern in town
in a quiet little out-of-the-way place
and they smiled at each other as he walked through the door
and they danced with their smiles on their faces
and they danced with a smile on their face
well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
because I know just what I'm going to do
i'll start to spend my money calling everybody honey
and I'll wind up singing the blues
i'll spend my whole paycheck on some old wreck
and brother I can name you a few
well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
because I know just what I'm going to do
i got to get drunk I just can't stay sober
there's a lot of good people in town
who like to see me holler see me spend my dollar
and I wouldn't dream of letting them down
there's a lot of doctors tell me
that I'd better start slowing it down
but there's more old drunks than there are old doctors
so I guess we'd better have another round
well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
because I know just what I'm going to do
i'll start to spend my money calling everybody honey
and I'll wind up singing the blues
i'll spend my whole paycheck on some old wreck
and brother I can name you a few
well I got to get drunk and I sure do dread it
because I know just what I'm going to do
it gets easier as we get older
it gets easier to say "not today"
and it gets easier as we get older
to say "go away not today"
i don’t have to do
one damn thing
that I don’t want to do
except for missing you
and that won't go away
it gets easier to say "some other time"
it gets easier to tell the world to wait
and it gets easier to watch the world fly by
and tell it "i will catch up but not today"
i don’t have to do
one damn thing
that I don’t want to do
except for missing you
and that won't go away
[verse 1]
oh they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
oh they tell me of a home far away
oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
oh they tell me of an unclouded day
oh the land of cloudless day
oh the land of an unclouded day
oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
oh they tell me of an unclouded day
[verse 2]
oh they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
oh they tell me of that land far away
where the tree of life in eternal bloom
sheds its fragrance through the unclouded day
oh the land of cloudless day
oh the land of an unclouded day
oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
oh they tell me of an unclouded day
[verse 3]
oh they tell me of a king in his beauty there
and they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
where he sits on the throne that is whiter than snow
in the city that is made of gold
oh the land of cloudless day
oh the land of an unclouded day
oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
oh they tell me of an unclouded day
[verse 4]
oh they tell me that he smiles on his children there
and his smile drives their sorrows all away
and they tell me that no tears ever come again
in that lovely land of unclouded day
oh the land of cloudless day
oh the land of an unclouded day
oh they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
oh they tell me of an unclouded day

funny a woman can come on so wild and free
yet insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch me
and stand by my bed and shiver as if she were cold
just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were gold
one night of love can't make up for six nights alone
but I'd rather have one than none lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
and sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
but she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
[verse 2]
right or wrong a woman can own any man
she can take him inside her and hold his soul in her hand
then leave him as weak and weary as a newborn child
fighting to get his first breath and open his eyes
one night of love can't make up for six nights alone
but I'd rather have one than none lord 'cause I'm flesh and bone
and sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
but she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at all
but she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at all
[verse 1]
playmate come out and play with me
and bring your dollies three
climb up my apple tree
look down my rain-barrel
slide down my cellar door
and we'll be jolly friends forever more
[chorus 1]
but she couldn't come out and play
it was a rainy day
with tearful eye she breathed a sigh
and I could hear her say
[chorus 2]
i'm sorry playmate I cannot play with you
my dolly's got the flu boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
hasn't got no rain-barrel hasn't got no cellar door
but we'll be jolly friends forever more
[chorus 1]
but she couldn't come out and play
it was a rainy day

i'm sorry playmate I cannot play with you
my dolly's got the flu boo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
hasn't got no rain-barrel hasn't got no cellar door
but we'll be jolly friends forever more
it was the time of the preacher
in the year of '01
just when you think it's all over
it's only begun
i'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
for what good is life without the one you love
i'd trade all of my tomorrows they're worthless anyway
if I can't hold the one I'm dreaming of
just an empty world is all I have before me
i'd give anything if you were with me now
i'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
i don't want to live without you anyhow
just an empty world is all I have before me
i'd give anything if you were with me now
and I'd trade all of my tomorrows for just one yesterday
i don't want to live without you anyhow
[verse 1]
when the evening sun goes down
you will find me hanging around
the night life ain't no good life
but it's my life
[verse 2]
many people just like me
dreaming of old used-to-be's
and the night life ain't no good life
but it's my life
listen to the blues that they're playing
listen to what the blues are saying
[verse 3]
life is just another scene
from the world of broken dreams
and the night life ain't no good life
but it's my life
the night life ain't no good life
but it's my life
i've got a couple more years on you baby and that's all
i've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
it ain't that I'm wiser it's just that I've spent
more time with my back to the wall
i've picked up a couple more years on you baby and that's all
i've walked a couple more roads than you baby and that's all
and I'm tired of running while you're only learning to crawl
and you're headed somewhere but I've been to somewhere
and found it was nowhere at all
i've picked up a couple more years on you baby and that's all
saying goodbye girl don't ever come easy at all
but you're gonna fly 'cause you're hearin' them young eagles call
someday when you're older you'll smile at a man strong and tall
you'll say I've got a couple more years on you baby and that's all
i've got a couple more years on you baby that's all
i've had more chances to fly and more places to fall
it ain't that I'm wiser it's just that I've spent
more time with my back to the wall
and I've picked up a couple more years on you baby and that's all
this is the very first day since you left me
and I've tried to put my thoughts in a song
but all I can hear myself singing
is I still can't believe you're gone
i still can't believe that you'd leave me
what did I do was so wrong
there's just too many unanswered questions
and I still can't believe you're gone
you're gone and I'm alone and I'm still living
i don't like it but I'll take it till I'm strong
and all I can hear myself singing is
is I still can't believe you're gone
and I still can't believe you're gone
[verse 1]
oh it's a long long while
from may to december
but the days grow short
when you reach september
when the autumn weather
turns leaves to flame
one hasn't got time
for the waiting game
oh the days dwindle down
to a precious few
september november
[verse 2]
and these few precious days
i'll spend with you
these precious days
i'll spend with you
oh the days dwindle down
to a precious few
september november
and these few precious days
i'll spend with you
these precious days
i'll spend with you
these precious days
i'll spend with you
he was a friend of mine
every time I think of him
i just can't keep from cryin'
'cause he was a friend of mine
he died on the road
he died on the road
he just kept on moving
never reaped what he could sow
and he was a friend of mine
i stole away and cried
i stole away and cried
'cause I never had too much money
and I never been quite satisfied
and he was a friend of mine
he never done no wrong
he never done no wrong
a thousand miles from home
and he never harmed no one
and he was a friend of mine
he was a friend of mine
he was a friend of mine
every time I hear his name lord
i just can't keep from cryin'
'cause he was a friend of mine
[verse 1]
we skipped the light fandango
and turned cartwheels cross the floor
i was feeling kind of seasick
but the crowd called out for more
the room was humming harder
and the ceiling flew away
when we called out for another drink
the waitress brought a tray
and so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale
[verse 2]
she said there is no reason
and the truth is plain to see
but I wandered through my playing cards
and would not let her be
one of sixteen vestal virgins
were leaving for the coast
although both my eyes were wide-open
they might just just have well been closed
and so it was that later
as the miller told his tale
that her face at first just ghostly
turned a whiter shade of pale
[verse 3 in concert]
she said she wanted shore leave
tho in truth we were at sea
so I took her by a looking glass
and forced her to agree
saying you must be the mermaid
who took neptune for a ride
well she smiled at me so sadly
that my anger straightway died
and so it was
[verse 1]
don't go changing to try and please me
you’ve never let me down before
and don't imagine you're too familiar
and I don’t see you anymore
i would not leave you in times of trouble
we never could have come this far
i took the good times and I'll take the bad times
i'll take you just the way you are
[verse 2]
and don't go trying some new fashion
don't change the color of your hair
you always have my unspoken passion
although I may not seem to care
i don't want clever conversation
i never want to work that hard
i just want someone that I can talk to
i want you just the way you are
[verse 3]
i need to know that you will always be
the same old someone that I knew
what will it take 'til you believe in me
the way that I believe in you
i said I love you and that's forever
and this I promise from the heart
but I couldn’t love you any better
i love you just the way you are
i don’t want clever conversation
i never want to work that hard
i just want someone that I can talk to
i want you just the way you are
i really can't stay
baby it's cold outside
i've got to go away
but baby it's cold outside
[verse 1]
this evening has been
been hoping that you'd drop in
so very nice
i'll hold your hands they're just like ice
my mother will start to worry
beautiful what's your hurry
my father will be pacing the floor
listen to that fireplace roar
so really I'd better scurry
beautiful please don't hurry
well maybe just a half a drink more
put some records on while I pour
neighbours might think
baby it's bad out there
say what's in this drink
no cabs to be had out there
i wish I knew how
your eyes are like starlight now
to break this spell
i'll take your hat your hair looks swell
i ought to say no no no sir
mind if I move in closer
at least I'm going to say that I tried
what's the sense in hurting my pride
[verse 2]
i simply must go
baby it's cold outside
oh the answer is no
baby it's cold outside
your welcome has been
how lucky that you dropped in
so nice and warm
look out the window at that storm
my sister will be suspicious
gosh your lips look delicious
my brother will be there at the door
waves upon a tropical shore
my maiden aunt's mind is so vicious
your lips are delicious
well maybe just a cigarette more
never such a blizzard before
i've got to go home
maybe you'll freeze out there
say lend me your coat
it's up to your knees out there
you've really been grand
i thrill when you touch my hand
but don't you see
how can you do this thing to me
there's bound to be talk tomorrow
think of my life long sorrow
at least there will be plenty implied
if you caught pneumonia and died
[verse 1]
can't go home if you're going by the mill
cause the bridge's washed out
at the bottom of the hill
big creek's up little creek's level
plow my corn with a double shovel
stay all night stay a little longer
dance all night dance a little longer
pull off your coat throw it in the corner
don't see why you can't stay a little longer
[verse 2]
sitting in the window singing to my love
slop bucket fell from the window up above
mule and the grasshopper eating ice cream
mule got sick so they laid him on the beam
stay all night stay a little longer
dance all night dance a little longer
pull off your coat throw it in the corner
don't see why you can't stay a little longer
[verse 3]
well you ought to see my blue eyed sally
she lives away down on shinbone alley
number on the gate the number on the door
the next house over is the grocery store
stay all night stay a little longer
dance all night dance a little longer
pull off your coat throw it in the corner
don't see why you can't stay a little longer
stay all night stay a little longer
dance all night dance a little longer
pull off your coat throw it in the corner
don't see why you can't stay a little longer
why are there so many songs about rainbows
and what's on the other side
rainbows are visions but only illusions
and rainbows have nothing to hide
so we've been told and some choose to believe it
i know they're wrong wait and see
someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me
who said that every wish would be heard and answered
when wished on the morning star
somebody thought of that and someone believed it
look what it's done so far
and what's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
and what do you think we might see
someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me
all of us wonder its spell
we know that it's probably magic
have you been half asleep and have you heard voices
i've heard them calling my name
is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors
the voice might be one in the same
i've heard it too many times to ignore it
it's something that I'm supposed to be
someday we'll find it the rainbow connection
the lovers the dreamers and me
counted the stars on the 4th of july
wishing they were rockets bursting into the sky
talking about redemption and leaving things behind
as the sun sank west of the mendocino county line
as fierce as monday morning feeling washed away
our orchestrated paradise couldn't make you stay
you dance with the horses through the sands of time
as the sun sinks west of the mendocino county line
i have these pictures and I keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know I'm doing fine
i used to make you happy once upon a time
but the sun sank west of the mendocino county line
the two of us together felt nothing but right
feeling you near immortal every friday night
lost in our convictions left stained with wine
as the sun sank west of the mendocino county line
i have these pictures and I keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know I'm doing fine
i used to make you happy once upon a time
but the sun sank west of the mendocino county line
i don't talk to you too much these days
i just thank the lord pictures don't fade
i spent time with an angel just passing through
now all that's left is this image of you
counted the stars on the 4th of july
wishing we were rockets bursting in the sky
talking about redemption and leaving things behind
i have these pictures and I keep these photographs
to remind me of a time
these pictures and these photographs
let me know I'm doing fine
we used to be so happy once upon a time
once upon a time
but the sun sank west of the mendocino county line
and the sun sank west of the mendocino county line

don't tell noah about the flood
and don't tell jesus about the blood
don't tell me that I've lost my mind
'cause I been crazy all the time
[verse 2]
don't tell the singer you like his song
then tell him you think he's playin' it wrong
don't tell me that I've lost my mind
'cause I been crazy all the time
[verse 3]

and make them see how wrong they went

'cause I been crazy all the time
[verse 4]

and don't tell jesus

your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
and I know that I am no good without you
you took apart that once was my heart
so why not take all of me
all of me why not take all of me
can't you see that I'm no good without you
take my arms I want to lose them
take my lips I'll never use them

and I know that I am no good without you
you took apart that once was my heart
so why not take all of me
[verse 1]

the more I reject it the more that it kicks in
just enough to keep me on my toes
i say come on time I've beat you before
come on time what have you got for me this time
i'll take your words of wisdom and I'll try to make 'em rhyme
hey it's just me and you again come on time
time you're not fooling me
you're something I can't kill
you're flying like a mighty wind

why did you leave these lines on my face
you sure have put me in my place
come on time come on time

you sure have put me in my place
come on time come on time
it looks like you're winning the race

there's a little house that sits upon a hill
that little house it sits so quiet and still
and it's filled with memories
and they're calling out to me
come back to that little house on the hill
that little house it sits so all alone
it needs someone to call it home sweet home
i'm traveling on my way
and I'm going back today
going back to that little house on the hill
on the hill on the hill
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
i'm traveling on my way
and I'm leaving here today
going back to that little house on the hill
that little house has weathered many storms
it's a place that feels so cozy and so warm
it's waiting there for me
and it's where I long to be
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
now when I get back to that house on the hill
i know it's gonna be such a thrill
i'll be glad when I get there
back to my favorite chair
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
on the hill on the hill
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
i'm traveling on my way
i'll be leaving here today
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
i'm going back to that little house on the hill
get down the fiddle and break out the bow
take off the gloves and throw down the hole
worked hard all week my back is sore
it's friday night I'm ready to roar
ready to roar ready to roar
it's five o'clock and I'm out that door
i'm hot and dusty I'm tired and wore
but it's friday night and I'm ready to roar
i've been pickin' this up and puttin' that down
tired of my boss bossin' me around
changin' my clothes goin' into town
find a little love and drink a little down
ready to roar ready to roar
it's five o'clock and I'm out that door
i'm hot and dusty I'm tired and wore
but it's friday night and I'm ready to roar
well I picked up a lid from a friend of mine
and the man picked me up now I'm doin' time
but I'm out tomorrow and if you see my friend
tell him meet me at the bar and we can try that again
he might not know me 'cause I'm low class
tell him I'm the one with his head up his ass
ready to roar ready to roar
it's five o'clock and I'm out that door
i'm hot and dusty I'm tired and wore
but it's friday night and I'm ready to roar
one more
i'd have to be crazy
to stop all my singing
and never play music again
you'd call me a fool
if I grabbed up the top hat
and ran out to flag down the wind
i'd have to be weird
to grow me a beard
just to see what the rednecks would do
but I'd have to be crazy
plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you
i know I've done weird things
i told people I heard things
when silence was all abounds
been days when it pleased me
to be on my knees
following ants
as they crawl across the ground
been insane on a train
but I'm still me again
in a place where I hold you is true
so I know I'm alright
cause I'd have to be crazy
to fall out of love with you
you know i
and I don't intend to
but should there come a day
when I say that I don't love you
you can lock me away ay ay
i sure would be dingy
to live in an envelope
waiting along for a stamp
you'd swear I was loco
to rub for a genie
while burning my hand on the lamp
and I may not be normal
but nobody is
so I'd like to say before I'm through
i'd have to be crazy
plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you
i'd have to be crazy
plum out of my mind
to fall out of love with you
well she made my day
but it ruined my life
she smiled at me
and I did not think twice
well I dove right in
into a world of strife
well she made my day
but it ruined my life
[verse 1]
i was mindin' my own business a-buzzin' 'round
my mind spinni' faster than the speed of sound
and I was perfectly happy when I ran into her
but she complicated me and the way things were
well she made my day
but it ruined my life
she smiled at me
and I did not think twice
well I dove right in

well it's a bloody mary morning
baby left me without warning
sometime in the night
so I'm flying down to houston
with forgetting her the nature of my flight
[verse 1]
as we taxi down the runway
with the smog and haze reminding me
of how I feel
just a country boy who's learning
that the pitfalls of the city
are extremely real
all the night life and parties
temptation and deceit
the order of the day
well it's a bloody mary morning
'cause I'm leaving baby
somewhere in la
well it's a bloody mary morning
baby left me without warning
sometime in the night
so I'm flying down to houston
with forgetting her the nature of my flight
[verse 2]
well our golden jet is airborne
and flight 50 cuts a path
across the morning sky
and a voice comes through the speaker
reassuring us flight 50 is the way to fly
and a hostess takes our order
coffee tea or something stronger
to start off the day
well it's a bloody mary morning
'cause I'm leaving baby
somewhere in la
well it's a bloody mary morning
baby left me without warning
sometime in the night
so I'm flying down to houston
with forgetting her the nature of my flight
yeah I'm flying down to houston
with forgetting her the nature of my flight
[verse 1]
i could hold out my arms say "i love you this much
i could tell you how long I will long for your touch
how much and how far would I go to prove
the depth and the breadth of my love for you
from here to the moon and back
who else in this world will love you like that
love everlasting I promise you that
from here to the moon and back
from here to the moon and back
[verse 2]
i want you to know you can always depend
on promises made and love without end
no need to wonder how faithful I'll be
now and on into eternity
[verse 3]
i would blow you a kiss from the star where I sat
i would call out your name to echo through the vast
thank heaven for you and to god tip my hat
from here to the moon and back
and I'll spend forever just proving that fact
[instrumental introduction]

hang them high in the street for all the people to see that
justice is the one thing you should always find
you got to saddle up your boys

well all meet back at the local saloon
well raise up our glasses against evil forces
singing whiskey for my men beer for my horses

send em all to their maker and hell settle em down

[verse 1]
one bright and guiding light
that taught me wrong from right
i find in my mother's eyes
[verse 2]
those fairy tales she told
of streets paved with gold
i find in my mother's eyes
just like a wandering sparrow
far from its foe
i walk the straight and narrow
just to reach my goal
god's gift sent from above
a real unselfish love
i find in my mother's eyes
just like a wandering sparrow
far from its foe
i walk the straight and narrow
just to reach my goal
god's gift sent from above
a real unselfish love
i find in my mother's eyes
[verse 1]
in this proud land we grew up strong
we were wanted all along
i was taught to fight taught to win
i never thought I could fail
no fight left or so it seems
i am a man whose dreams have all deserted
i've changed my face I've changed my name
but no one wants you when you lose
don't give up because you have friends
don't give up you're not beaten yet
don't give up I know you can make it good
[verse 2]
though I saw it all around
i never thought that I could be affected
i thought that we would be the last to go
it is so strange the way things turn
drove the night toward my home
the place that I was born on the lakeside
and as daylight broke I saw the earth
the trees had burned down to the ground
don't give up you still have us
don't give up we don't need much of anything
don't give up because somewhere there's a place
there's a place where we belong
[verse 3]
got to walk out of here
i can't take anymore
i'm going to stand on that bridge
keep my eyes down below
whatever may come
and whatever may go
that river's flowing [x2]
moved on to another town
tried hard to settle down
for every job so many men
so many men no one needs
don't give up because you have friends
don't give up you're not the only one
don't give up no reason to be ashamed
don't give up you still have us
don't give up now we're proud of who you are
don't give up you know it's never been easy
don't give up because I believe there's a place
there's a place where we belong
[verse 1]
well I've been a lot of places in my life and time
i've sung a lot of songs and I've made some bad rhyme
i've acted out my love in stages with ten thousand people watching
now we're alone and I am singing my song for you
[verse 2]
and I know your image of me is what I hope to be
i've treated you unkindly but darling can't you see
no one more important to me darling can't you please see through me
now we're alone and I am singing my song for you
[verse 3]
well you taught me precious secrets of a truth with holding nothing
you came out in front but I was hiding
now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together
listen to the melody cause my love is in there hiding
and I love you in a place where there's no space or time
i love you for my life you are a friend of mine
and when my life is over remember when we were together
now we're alone and I am singing my song for you
after carefully considering
the whole situation I stand with my back to the wall
walking is better than running away and crawling ain't no good at all
and if guilty's the question truth is the answer I've been lying to me all alone
there ain't nothing worth saving except one another
and before you'll wake up I'll be gone
[chorus] [2x]
and crawling ain't no good at all
[verse 1]
i got dog I got a cat
an iphone and a hip-hop hat
but I ain't got nothin' 'cause you ain't here with me
[verse 2]
i got house I got a barn
a big truck and a red jaguar
but I ain't got nothin' 'cause you ain't here with me
one night I come home to greet you honey
i found a note sayin' "goodbye I took all of your money"
i got [ben] he's got weed
i got everything a man outta need
but I ain't got nothin' 'cause you ain't here with me
it's a lonely summer night and memories linger
of when I gave you a ring and you gave me the finger
[verse 3]
i got a horse I got a saddle
i got a coffeeshop in seattle
but I ain't got nothin' if you ain't here with me
one night I come home to greet you honey
i found a note sayin' "goodbye I took all of your money"
i got [ben] he's got weed
i got everything a man outta need
but I ain't got nothin' 'cause you ain't here with me
oh I ain't got nothin' 'cause you ain't here with me
i've got a long list of real good reasons
for all the things I've done
i've got a picture in the back of my mind
of what I've lost and what I've won
i've survived every situation
knowing when to freeze and when to run
and regret is just a memory written on my brow
and there's nothing I can do about it now
i've got a wild and a restless spirit
i held my price through every deal
i've seen the fire of a woman's scorn
turn her heart of gold to steel
i've got the song of the voice inside me
set to the rhythm of the wheel
and I've been dreaming like a child
since the cradle broke the bow
and there's nothing I can do about it now
running through the changes
going through the stages
coming round the corners in my life
leaving doubt to fate
staying out too late
waiting for the moon to say goodnight
and I could cry for the time I've wasted
but that's a waste of time and tears
and I know just what I'd change
if went back in time somehow
but there's nothing I can do about it now
running through the changes
going through the stages
coming round the corners in my life
leaving doubt to fate
staying out too late
waiting for the moon to say goodnight
and I could cry for the time I've wasted
but that's a waste of time and tears
and I know just what I'd change
if went back in time somehow
but there's nothing I can do about it now
i'm forgiving everything that forgiveness will allow
and there's nothing I can do about it now
i made a mistake lord
i thought I was wrong
i said take it and git
she said got it and gone
so I'm writing it all down
in this stupid ol' song
i made a mistake lord
i thought I was wrong
i'm a lot like ol' ripley
on "believe it or not"
i told a big lie lord
and then I forgot
i thought I was jesus
and believe me I'm not
i thought I was right
and I was wrong by a lot
i feel a little like elvis
when he was alone
i made another mistake lord
i thought I was wrong
i made a mistake lord
and it's all on me
i wouldn't admit it
but it's easy to see
so if anyone's praying
a request I would make
is to mention my name 'cause
i made a mistake
i'm a lot like ol' ripley
on "believe it or not"
i told a big lie lord
and then I forgot
i thought I was jesus
and believe me I'm not
i thought I was right
and I was wrong by a lot
i feel a little like elvis
when he was alone
i made another mistake lord
i thought I was wrong
i made another mistake lord
i thought I was wrong
[chorus 1]
two one two three four one
if you've got the money honey I've got the time
we'll go honky tonking and we'll have a time
we'll have more fun baby all way down the line
[verse 1]
if you've got the money honey I've got the time
there ain't no need to tarry let's start out tonight
we'll have fun oh boy oh boy and we'll do it right
[chorus 2]
bring along your cadillac leave my old wreck behind
if you've got the money honey I've got the time
[verse 2]
we'll go honky tonking make every spot in town
we'll go to the every spot and leave all gold around
if you run short of money I'll run short of time
[chorus 1]
if you've got the money honey I've got the time
we'll go honky tonking and we'll have a time
we'll have more fun baby all way down the line
[chorus 2]
bring along your cadillac leave my old wreck behind
if you've got the money honey I've got the time
you had your run
and it's been a good one
seems like the world is passing you by
oh father time
he just keeps on ticking
still got a lot of life and a song to sing
you fell in love
back in the day
can't forget her face
can't remember her name
she was a beauty
a shining star
just when you weren't looking she broke your heart
you been down every highway
burned your share of bridges
you found forgiveness
you think that you're still a young bull rider
until you look in the mirror and see an old timer
one by one
your friends have crossed over
you pray for mercy and a few more days
still got dreams inside your head
someday it's a struggle just to get out of bed
you been down every highway
burned your share of bridges
you found forgiveness
you think you're still a young bull rider
until you look in the mirror and see an old timer
i'm not trying to forget you anymore
i got back into remembering all the love we shared before
and I'd been trying to forget someone who my heart still adores
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
you were someone who brought happiness into my life
and it did not last forever but that's all right
we were always more than lovers and I'm still your friend
and if I had the chance I'd do it all again
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
i got back into remembering all the love we had before
and the best days of my life are still when you walk through that door
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
[chorus 1]
i'm looking over a four leaf clover
that I overlooked before
first is the sunshine the second is rain
third is the roses that bloom in the lane
[chorus 2]
there's no need explaining
the one remaining is somebody I adore
i'm looking over a four leaf clover
that I overlooked before
[chorus 1]
i'm looking over a four leaf clover
that I overlooked before
first is the sunshine the second is rain
third is the roses that bloom in the lane
[chorus 2]
there's no need explaining
the one remaining is somebody I adore
i'm looking over a four leaf clover
that I overlooked before
there's no need explaining
the one remaining is somebody I adore
i'm looking over a four leaf clover
that I overlooked before
i wish I didn't love you so
my love for you should have faded long ago
i wish I didn't need your kiss
why must your kiss torture me as long as this
i should be smilin' by now
with some new tender friend
smilin' by now
with my heart on the mend
but when I try
something in my heart says "no"
and that's why
i wish I didn't love you so
[verse 1]
a long time forgotten
are dreams that just fell by the way
and the good life he promised
is not what she's living to day
but she never complains of
the bad times or bad things he's done
she's just talks about the good times
they've had and all the good times to come
she's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man
and she loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand
and through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass though this world hand in hand
this good hearted woman
in love with her good timin' man
[verse 2]
now he likes the night life
the bright lights and good timin' friends
and when the party's all over
she welcome him back home again
though she don't understand him
she does the best that she can
this good hearted woman
in love with her good timin' man
she's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man
and she loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand
and through teardrops and laughter
they'll pass though this world hand in hand
this good hearted woman
in love with her good timin' man
she's a good hearted woman
in love with a good timin' man
and she loves him in spite of his ways
that she don't understand
your memory has a mind of its own
it knows where to go when it's gone
i think I've lost it then it proves me wrong
your memory has a mind of its own
i can't tell it what to do
i can smoke and I can drink until it's out of view
but I can't hold it off it's too strong
your memory has a mind of its own
your memory does what it wants to do
it survives though I don't want it to
i do ok when I don't think of you
but your memory does what it wants to do
if your memory had ears they'd be burnin'
if your memory had eyes they'd be cryin'
and if it had a heart it would leave me alone
but your memory has a mind of its own
i can't tell it what to do
i can smoke and I can drink until it's out of view
but I can't hold it off it's too strong
your memory has a mind of its own
your memory has a mind of its own
you don't know me
you give your hand to me
and then you say hello
and I can hardly speak
my heart is beating so
and anyone can tell
you think you know me well
but you don't know me
[verse 1]
no you don't know the one
who thinks of you at night
and longs to kiss your lips
and yearns to hold you tight
to you I'm just a friend
that's all I've ever been
no you don't know me
[chorus 1]
for I never knew the art of making love
though my heart aches with love for you
afraid and shy I let my chance go by
the chance that you might love me too
[chorus 2]
you give your hand to me
and then you say goodbye
i watch you walk away
beside a lucky guy
to never never know
the one who loves you so
no you don't know me
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
you don't know me
there's a land where I've been told
every street is paved with gold
and it's just across the borderline
when it's time to take your turn
here's a lesson that you must learn
you can lose more than you'll ever find
when you reach the broken promise land
every dream slips through your hand
you'll know it's too late to change your mind
because you paid the price to come to far
just to wind up where you are
and you're still just across the borderline
up and down the rio grande
a thousand footprints in the sand
reveal the secret no one can define
the river flows on like a breath
in between our life and death
who's the next to cross the borderline
hope remains when pride is gone
and it keeps you moving on
calling you across the borderline
and you're still just across the borderline
you call us heathens with zero respect for the law
we are only songwriters just writing our songs and that's all
we write what we live and we live what we write is that wrong
if you think it is mr music executive
why don't you write your own songs
and don't listen to minethey might run you crazy
they might make you dwell on your feelings a moment too long
we're making you rich and you're already lazy
so just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songs
mr purified country don't you know what the whole things about
is your head up your ass so far that you can't pull it out
the world's getting smaller and everyone in it belongs
and if you can't see that mr purified country
why don't you just write your own songs
and don't listen to minethey might run you crazy
they might make you dwell on your feelings a moment too long
we're making you rich and you're already lazy
so just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songs
so just lay on your ass and get richer or write your own songs
[verse 1]
when I ran to the store with a penny
and when youth was abundant and plenty
classify these as good times
good times
[verse 2]
when I rolled rubber tires in the driveway
pulled a purse on a string across the highway
classify these as good times
good times
good times are coming humming mmm
good times are coming humming mmm
[verse 3]
go to school fight a war working steady
meet a girl fall in love before I'm ready
classify these as good times
good times
[verse 4]
here I sit with a drink and a memory
but I'm not cold I'm not wet and I'm not hungry
so classify these as good times
good times
good times are coming humming mmm
good times
good times are coming humming mmm
[instrumental intro]
[verse 1]
oh oh deep water black and cold like the night
i stand with arms wide open I've run a twisted mile
i'm a stranger in the eyes of the maker
[verse 2]
i could not see for fog in my eyes
i could not feel for the fear in my life
and across the great divide in the distance I saw a light
saw jean baptiste walking to me with the maker
[verse 3]
my body is bent and broken by long and dangerous leaps
i can't work the fields of abraham and turn my head away
i'm not a stranger in the hands of the maker
[verse 4]
brother john have you seen the homeless daughters
standing there with broken wings
i have seen the flaming swords there over east of eden
burning in the eyes of the maker
burning in the eyes of the maker
burning in the eyes of the maker
oh river oh river rise from your sleep
[verse 1]
well I like cause you're hotter than the forth of july
and I like you cause you've got that wild look in your eyes
i like you 'cause you're reckless and free as a breeze
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me
i like you cause you like to stay up all night
i like the way you do me when you do me just right
you threw a weekend party and it lasted all week
and I love you 'cause you're crazy like me
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me
i know your momma don't care for me much
but I believe her daddy is getting used to us
and they both thinking that we're out []
oh I love you 'cause you're crazy like me yeah
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me yeah
[verse 2]
i like you cause you like to chug a lug of beer
dancing and grinning from ear to ear
and I like it when you're buzzing like a bumble bee
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me
i like you because you have a little []
and I like that little tattoo there on your tush
i like you 'cause you're as sweet as sweet can be
and I like you 'cause you're crazy like me
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me
[chorus 2]
i know your momma don't care for me much
but I believe your daddy is getting used to us
and they both thinking that we're out []
yeah I love you 'cause you're crazy like me yeah
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me yeah
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me yeah
i love you 'cause you're crazy like me
i have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle as she flies
turning on the world the way you smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
and healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of your eyes
waking in the morning to the feeling of your fingers on my skin
wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
teaching me that yesterday was something that I never thought of trying
talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we have to spend
loving you is easier than anything I'll ever do again
coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
you ain't ashamed to be a woman you know just gotta be a friend
i don't know the answers to the easy way
you opened every door in my mind
dreaming is as easy as believing it's never gonna end
loving you is easier than anything I'll ever do again
loving you is easier than anything I'll ever do again
high on a mountain in western montana
a silhouette moves 'cross a cinnamon sky
riding alone on a horse he called music
with a song on his lips and a tear in his eye
he dreams of a time and a lady that loved him
and how he would sing her sweet lullabies
but we don't ever ask him
and he never talks about her
guess it is better to just let it slide
but sang "ooh" to the ladies
and ooh he made some sigh
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye
he rode the music from boston to bozeman
for not too much money but way to much ride
but those were the days when a horse he called music
could jump through the moon and sail across the sky
now all that's left is a time-old worn cowboy
with nothing more than the sweet by-and-by
and trailing behind is a horse with no rider
a horse he calls memories that she used to ride
and he sang "ooh" to the ladies
and ooh he damn near made some fall right down and die
now he rides away on a horse he called music
with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye
high on a mountain in western montana
two crosses cut through a cinnamon sky
marking the place where a horse he called music
lays with a cowboy in the sweet by-and-by
[chorus 1]
no mas amore no mas amore aqui
no love to be found
no one around now but me
last time I saw her
was down by the edge of the sea
no mas amore no mas amore aqui
[chorus 2]
i would have followed you to anywhere
nowhere I wouldn't have gone
you could have taken me anywhere
you had to go it alone
[chorus 1]
down by the rocks
where the waves play the shore like a drum
sometimes I swear
i can hear her guitar gently strum
i walk the beach
underneath the moons pale blue light
haunted by the song
of a love lost to the changing tide
[chorus 2]
[chorus 1]
[verse 1]
sometimes I think that love is somewhere
living on an island all alone
i can see it in the darkness
i can feel it in the distance and then it's gone
and then I know that it is time
for me to go and find my favorite girl
cause when I look into her eyes I see
all the love there is in all over the world
and it always will be
and it always will be
and it always will be
it always will be
[verse 2]
there are some things I think about
and every time I do it breaks my heart
and there is nothing I can do
about this loneliness I feel when we're apart
and I stop and curse the darkness and the distance
and then your face I've see
and when I look into your eyes I've see
all the love there is inside of me
[verse 1]
give us your tired and weak
and we will make them strong
bring us your foreign songs
and we will sing along
leave us your broken dreams
we'll give them time to mend
there's still a lot of love
living in the promiseland
living in the promiseland
our dreams are made of steel
the prayer of every man
is to know how freedom feels
there is a winding road
across the shifting sand
and room for everyone
living in the promiseland
[verse 2]
so they came from a distant isle
nameless woman
faithless child like a bad dream
until there was no room at all
no place to run and no place to fall
give us our daily bread
we have no shoes to wear
no place to call our home
only this cross to bear
we are the multitudes
lend us a helping hand
is there no love anymore
living in the promiseland
living in the promiseland
our dreams are made of steel
the prayer of every man
is to know how freedom feels
there is a winding road
across the shifting sand
and room for everyone
living in the promiseland
[verse 1]
the summer wind came blowin' in from across the sea
it lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me
all summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand
two sweethearts and that summer wind
[verse 2]
like painted kites those days and nights they went flyin' by
the world was new beneath a blue umbrella sky
then softer than a piper man one day it called to you
well I lost you I lost you to that summer wind
[verse 3]
now the autumn wind and the winter winds they have come and gone
still the days the lonely days go on and on
and guess who sighs his lullabies through nights that never end
my fickle friend that summer wind
oh the summer wind
the warm warm summer wind
i got one more song to write
and I've got one more bridge to burn
i've got one more endless night
one more lesson to be learned
one more hill to climb
and it's somewhere in my mind
i'll know it when it's right
i've got one more song to write
i got one more horse to ride
and no more secrets left to hide
no more staring at the sun
just to watch them ponies run
no more bounty to divide
there ain't no secrets left to hide
my life's an open book
turn the page and have a look
i got one more song to write
and I've got one more bridge to burn
i've got one more endless night
one more lesson to be learned
one more hill to climb
and it's somewhere in my mind
but I'll know it when it's right
i've got one more song to write
i got one more song to write
i got one more bridge to burn
i've got one more endless night
one more lesson to be learned
one more hill to climb
and it's somewhere in my mind
i'll know it when it's right
i've got one more song to write
[verse 1]
i see trees of green red roses too
i see them bloom for me and you
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
[verse 2]
i see skies of blue and clouds of white
the bright blessed days the dark sacred nights
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
the colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
are also on the faces of people going by
i see friends shaking hands saying "how do you do"
they're really saying 'i love you'
[verse 3]
i hear babies crying watch them grow
they'll learn much more than I'll never know
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
and I think to myself what a wonderful world
[chorus 1]
she said I ain't gonna fix you no more sausage

or fix you nothing else that's chicken fried

something a little more your size
and don't come back to me a moaning
when she cuts you off of burgers and fries

she was always looking for the peccadillo
i hope she went to mexico

where's december's happy crew

every time I hear that rainy chill wind blow
i think it might be time to head to mexico
señor señor do you know where we're headin'
lincoln county road or armageddon
seems like I been down this way before
is there any truth in that señor
señor señor do you know where she is hidin'
how long are we gonna be ridin'
how long must I keep my eyes glued to the door
will there be any comfort there señor
there's a wicked wind still blowin' on that upper deck
there's an iron cross still hanging down from around her neck
there's a marchin' band still playin' in that vacant lot
where she held me in her arms one time and said "forget me not"
señor señor I can see that painted wagon
i can smell the tail of the dragon
can't stand the suspense anymore
can you tell me who to contact here señor
well the last thing I remember before I stripped and kneeled
was that trainload of fools bogged down in a magnetic field
a gypsy with a broken flag and a flashing ring
said "son this ain't a dream no more it's the real thing"
señor señor you know their heart's here is as hard as leather
well give me a minute let me get it together
i just gotta pick myself up off the floor
and I'm ready when you are señor
[salvador duran]
como el viento en la montaña lo encontré la última vez
tratando de encontrar el alma o perdiendo
como el medio del abismo el amor que no encontró
en la noche los tiempos con el oro se quedó
señor señor let's disconnect these cables
overturn these tables
this place don't make sense to me no more
can you tell me what we're waiting for señor
[verse 1]
there's a boat race down the river
there's a slow boat on my mind
everybody's going like crazy
i'm taking my own sweet time
i'll drift down to big shark river
take a boat ride along the bay
just trying to find a little peace of mind
down in the everglades
there ain't gonna be no hurry
there ain't gonna be no rush
just a lazy style like a crocodile
playin' in the mangrove brush
i'll float on down the river
let the speed boat speed away
i'll drift around making gator sounds
down in the everglades
[verse 2]
while the big crowd down the rivers
are gettin' drunk on sea grape wine
i'm gettin' high watchin' eagles fly
havin' myself a time
wet my whistle every now and then
with a sip of cool gatorade
watch the sun go down and let the world go 'round
down in the everglades
there ain't gonna be no hurry
there ain't gonna be no rush
just a lazy style like a crocodile
playin' in the mangrove brush
i'll float on down the river
let the speed boat speed away
i'll drift around making gator sounds
down in the everglades
i'll drift around makin' gator sounds
down in the everglades
[verse 1]
miracles appear
in the strangest of places
fancy meeting you here
the last time I saw you
was just out of houston
sit down let me buy you a beer
your presence is welcome
with me and my friend here
this is a hangout of mine
we come here quite often
and listen to music
partaking of yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine
i'm yesterday's wine
ageing with time
like yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine
we're yesterday's wine
ageing with time
like yesterday's wine
[verse 2]
you give the appearance
of one widely travelled
i'll bet you've seen
things in your time
so sit down beside me
and tell me your story
if you think you're like yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine
we're yesterday's wine
ageing with time
like yesterday's wine
yesterday's wine
we're yesterday's wine
ageing with time
like yesterday's wine

the quiet way she sits there with her hand in mine
that's why I love her so that's why I love her so
and the way she's always tender with my mind
that's why I love her so that's why I love her so
in a crowded room you'll never know she's there
unless I need her and if I really need her
she'll gladly tell the world how much she cares
that's why I love her so that's why I love her so
in a crowded room[]
that's why I love her so that's why I love her so

this looks like a december day
this looks like a time to remember day
[verse 1]
and I remember the spring such a sweet tender thing
and love's summer college
where the green leaves of knowledge
were waiting to fall with the fall
[verse 2]
and where september wine
numbed the measure of time
through the tears of october now november's over
and this looks like a december day
this looks like a december day
it looks like we've come to the end of the way
[verse 3]
and as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
the ending that won't go away
and as my memories race back to love's eager beginning

the closer I get to my home lord the more I want to be there
there'll be a gathering of loved ones and friends lord you know I want to be there
there'll be a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours
'bout how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there
well there's old charlie toll they threw away the mold when they made him
and jimmy mccline it looks like the wine's finally laid him
and billie mcrae that I could beat any day in a card game
and bessie mcneal but her tears are real I can see pain
there's a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours
'bout how wild I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there
lord thanks for ride I got a feeling inside that I know you
and if you see your way you're welcome to stay 'cause I'm going to need you
there's a mixture of teardrops and flowers crying and talking for hours
'bout how wild that I was and if I'd listened to them I wouldn't be there

forgiving you was easy
but forgetting seems to take the longest time
i just keep thinking
and your memory is forever on my mind
you know I'll always love you
and I can't forget the days when you were mine
forgiving you is easy
but forgetting seems to take the longest time
[verse 2]
the bitter fruit of anger
growing from the seeds of jealousy
oh what a heartache
but I forgive the things you said to me
you know I'll always love you
and I can't forget the days when you were mine
forgiving you is easy
but forgetting seems to take the longest time
[verse 3]
the years have passed so quickly
as once again fate steals a young man's dreams
of all the golden years
and growing old together you and me
you know I'll always love you
and I can't forget the days when you were mine
forgiving you is easy
but forgetting seems to take the longest time
you know I'll always love you
and I can't forget the days when you were mine
forgiving you is easy
but forgetting seems to take the longest time
[verse 1]
i knew that you had hurt me bad
the brokest heart I ever had
and I'm still right where you let me fall
so I don't have very far to crawl
you kicked me right in the heart babe
i shouldn't even be here at all
tryin' hard to get back to you
i don't have very far to crawl
[verse 2]
i don't have very far to go
to where you'll walk on me again
and it don't bother you at all
that I don't have very far to crawl
you kicked me right in the heart babe
i shouldn't even be here at all
tryin' hard to get back to you
i don't have very far to crawl
i don't have very far to crawl
so I don't have very far to crawl
it's not supposed to be that way
you're supposed to know I love you
but it don't matter anyway
if I can't be there to control you
like the other little children
you're gonna dream a dream or two
but be careful what you're dreamin'
or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you
it's not supposed to be that way
you're supposed to know I love you
but it don't matter anyway
if I can't be there to console you
when you go out to play this evenin'
play with fire flies till they're gone
then you rush to meet your lover
and play with real fire till the dawn
but it's not supposed to be that way
you're supposed to know I love you
but it don't matter anyway
if I can't be there to console you
when you go out to play this evenin'
[verse 1]
come all you young feller's so young and so fine
and seek not your fortunes way down in the mine
it will form like a habit and seep in your soul
until the stream of your blood flows as black as the coal
it's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
where the dangers are double and the pleasures are few
where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines
[verse 2]
there is many a man I have seen in my day
who lived just to labour his whole life away
like the fiend with his dope and the drunkard his wine
a man will have lust for the lure of the mine
[verse 3]
i hope when I'm dead and the ages shall roll
that my body will blacken and turn into coal
i will look from the door of my heavenly home
and pity the miner a' digging my bones
it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
it's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
[verse 1]
summertime and the living is easy
fish are biting and the cotton is high
your daddy's rich and your mammy's good looking
so hush little baby don't want you cry
[verse 2]
some of these days you're gonna rise up smiling
spread your wings and take to the sky
till that time there ain't nothing going to harm you
[verse 1]
if I'd only had one arm to hold you
better yet if I had none at all
then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
there'd be one less memory to recall
[verse 2]
if I'd only had one ear to listen
to the lies that you told to me
then I'd more closely resemble
the half a man that you've made of me
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
if I'd only had one leg to stand on
then a much a much truer picture you'd see
for then I more closely resemble
the half a man that you've made of me
still is still moving to me and I swim like a fish in the sea all the time
but if that's what it takes to be free I don't mind
still is still moving to me still is still moving to me
and it's hard to explain how I feel
it won't go in words but I know that it's real
i can be moving or I can be still but still is still moving to me
still is still moving to me
and it's hard to explain how I feel it won't go in words but I know that it's real
i can be moving or I can be still
but still is still moving me still is still moving to me
and it's hard to explain how I feel
still is still moving to me still is still moving to me still is still moving to me
[verse 1]
just like the sun over the mountain top
you know I'll always come again
you know I love to spend my morning time
like sunlight dancing on your skin
and I have never gone so long just for telling lies to you
what you've seen is what I've been
there is nothing that I can hide a few
you see me better than I can
out on the road that lies before me now
there are some turns where I will spin
i only hope that you will hold me now
'till I gain control again
[verse 2]
just like a lighthouse you must stand alone
and mark the sailors journey's end
and no matter what sea that I've been sailing on
i'll always roll this way again
out on the road that lies before me now
there are some turns where I will spin
i only hope that you will hold me now
'till I gain control again
out on the road that lies before me now
there are some turns where I will spin
i only hope that you will hold me now
'till I gain control again
pennies in a stream
fallen leaves of sycamore
moonlight in vermont
icy fingers waves
ski trails on a mountain side
snow light in vermont
telegraph cables
they swing down the highway
and travel each bend in the road
people who meet in this romantic setting
are so hypnotized by the lovely
evening summer breeze
warbling of a meadow lark
moonlight in vermont
telegraph cables

was it wonderful for you
was it holly as it was for me
did you feel the hand of destiny
that was guiding us together
you were young enough to dream
and I was old enough to learn something new
i'm so glad I got to dance with you
for a moment of forever
sometimes when you're crying you're happy
and sometimes you're just crying
i know I know
and come whatever happens now
ain't it nice to know that dreams still come true
i'm so glad that I was close to you
for a moment of forever
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
they'd rather give you a song than diamonds or gold
lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis
and each night begins a new day
if you don't understand him and he don't die young
he'll probably just ride away
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
cowboys like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
them that don't know him won't like him and them that do
sometimes won't know how to take him
he ain't wrong he's just different but his pride won't let him
do things to make you think he's right
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mamas don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
'cause they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
phases and stages circles and cycles and scenes that we've all seen before
let me tell you some more
washing the dishes scrubbing the floors
caring for someone who don't care anymore
learning to hate all the things that she once loved to do
like washing his shirts and never complaining except of red stains on the collars
ironing and crying crying and ironing caring for someone who don't care anymore
someday she'll just walk away
i'm not trying to forget you anymore
i've got back into remembering all the love we had before
and I'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
you're just someone who brought happiness into my life
and it did not last forever oh but that's alright
we were always more than lovers and I'm still your friend
and if I had the chance I'd do it all again
i'm not trying to forget you anymore
i've got back into remembering all the love we had before
and I'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
i'm not trying to forget you anymore
i've got back into remembering all the love we had before
and I'd been trying to forget someone that my heart still adores
so I'm not trying to forget you anymore
[verse 1]
it would be a comfort to know you'd never doubt me
even though I give you cause most every day
sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me
although I love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 2]
don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wander
to a suddenly remembered yesterday
my mind could never stay too long away from you
because I love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 3]
and though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
though my faults may grow in number day by day
let no one ever say I've ever been untrue
i'll always love you in my own peculiar way
i'll always love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 1]
the lights go out each evening at eleven
and up and down our block there's not a sound
i close my eyes and search for peaceful slumber
and just then the local memory comes around
[chorus 1]
piles of blues against the door to make sure sleep will come no more
he's the hardest working memory in this town
turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back in
and each night the local memory comes around
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
each day I say tonight I may escape him
i pretend I'm happy and never even frown
but at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds me
but again the local memory comes around
[chorus 2]
rids the house of all good news and then sets out my crying shoes
what a faithful memory never lets me down
we're both up 'til light of day chasing happiness away
and each night the local memory comes around
and each night the local memory comes around
[vesre 1]
all I can hear are the crickets
and the whistle from some lonely freight
i've been working so hard to make everything right
but for now it'll just have to wait
because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
i'd like you to sing me a song
i'm tired of trying to figure things out
and I'm tired of being so strong
[verse 2]
i've never been too good at asking
i'm more apt to do it alone
and it's strange how a lot of us think something's wrong
if we can't do it all on our own
because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
i'd like you to sing me a song
i'm tired of trying to figure things out
and I'm tired of being so strong
[verse 3]
it's funny how times when your hurting
make what's so familiar seem strange
and when you need help it's hardest to ask
and it always takes so long to change
because tonight I'd like you to rock me to sleep
i'd like you to sing me a song
i'm tired of trying to figure things out
and I'm tired of being so strong
there is somebody
i'm longing to see
i hope that she
turns out to be
someone who'll watch over me
i'm a little lamb
who's lost in the wood
i know I could
always be good
to one who'll watch over me
although she may not be the girl
some men think of
as pretty
to my heart
she carries the key
won't you tell her please
to put on some speed
follow my lead
oh how I need
someone to watch over me
although she may not be the girl
some men think of
as pretty
to my heart
she carries the key
won't you tell her please
to put on some speed
follow my lead
oh how I need
someone to watch over me
someone to watch over me
[verse 1]
there's a land that is fairer than day
and by faith we can see it afar
for the father waits over the way
to prepare us a dwelling place there
in the sweet by and by
we shall meet on that beautiful shore
in the sweet by and by
we shall meet on that beautiful shore
[verse 2]
we shall sing on that beautiful shore
the melodious songs of the blessed
and our spirits shall sorrow no more
not a sigh for the blessing of rest
[verse 3]
to our bountiful father above
we will offer our tribute of praise
for the glorious gift of his love
and the blessings that hallow our days
[verse 1]
what do you do with the sands of time
when they carve out lines around your eyes
i can close my fists up good and tight
but I can't hold back the sands of time
what do you do with a memory
that just hangs around and stares at me
i can tear that frame down off the wall
but it won't erase the things I saw
night and day
night and day
you remain
you remain
[verse 2]
what do you do with old regrets
there's a box full underneath the bed
just close enough not to forget
but do what do you do with old regrets
there's old house key in a kitchen drawer
to the door I can't unlock no more
sometimes I hold that key real tight
but what do you do after goodbye
night and day
night and day
you remain
you remain [x2]
[verse 1]
one day I got the notion to teach a fish to fly
so I went down to the ocean when the tide was plenty high
found a fish we talked and I pointed to the sky
but he didn't even try no he didn't even try
no one listens to wise old me
and I know how things ought to be
i ain't blind but sure don't see
why no one listens to wise old me
[verse 2]
one day I said to me "let's teach a bird to swim"
so I climbed way up a tree and I went out on a limb
found a bird we talked and I pointed to the sea
and that bird just sang to me that bird just sang to me
as sure as clouds live in the sky there's a place for you and i
if you don't learn to let things be you'll find your wise self up a tree
now please do not be frightened by the things that sound absurd
as how man can be enlightened by the wisdom of a bird
and so can you so let it be a lesson for today
and may I never hear you say may I never hear you say
no one listens to wise old me
and I know how things ought to be
i ain't blind but sure don't see
why no one listens to wise old me
no one listens to wise old me
well it's cloudy in the morning going to be raining in the afternoon
cloudy in the morning and it's going to be raining in the afternoon
if you don't like this rainy weather you better pack your bags and move
but if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see
if you're running from it brother the only road that I can see [x2]
is the road that leads to nowhere and nowhere is a fool like me
rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
ain't never seen so much rainy weather
guess I'll never see the sun again
save those dimes and nickels save them for a rainy day
save your dimes and nickels save them for a rainy day
it ain't going to keep the rain from coming
but at least you know you've paid your way
rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
rain keep a falling falling around my window pane
ain't never seen so much rainy weather
guess I'll never see the sun again
[verse 1]
my world is like a river as dark as it is deep
night after night the past slips in and gathers all my sleep
my days are just an endless stream of emptiness to me
filled only by the fleeting moments of her memories
sweet memories
sweet memories
[verse 2]
she slipped into the silence of my dreams last night
wandering from room to room turning on each light
her laughter spills like water from the river to the sea
and I'm swept away from sadness clinging to her memories
sweet memories
sweet memories
[verse 1]
i had not planned on seeing you
i was afraid of what I'd do
but pride is strong and here am i
and I just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 2]
please have no fear you're in no harm
as long as you're here in my arms
but you can't leave so please don't try
i just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 3]
what force behind your evil mind
can make your lips speak so unkind
to one who loves as much as i
but I just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 4]
the flesh around your throat is pale
intended by my fingernails
please don't scream and please don't cry
i just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 5]
your voice is still it speaks no more
you'll never hurt me anymore
death is a friend to love and i
'cause now you'll never say goodbye goodbye
[verse 1]
when I look at the letter that you wrote to me
it's you that I'm thinking of
as I read the lines that to me were so sweet
i remember our faded love
i miss you darling more and more every day
as heaven would miss the stars above
with every heartbeat I still think of you
and remember our faded love
[verse 2]
as I think of the past and all the pleasure we had
as I watch the mating of a dove
and it was in the springtime that we said goodbye
i remember our faded love
i've been too sick to pray lord
that's why we haven't talked in a while
it's been some of those days lord
i thought I was on my last mile
but I'm feeling ok lord
and I'm glad taht I called you today
never need you more
i woulda called you before
but I've been too sick to pray
remember the family lord
i know they will remember you
and all of their prayers lord
they talk to you just like I do
well I reckon that's all lord
that's all I can think to say
and thank you my friend
we'll be talking again
if I'm not too sick to pray
[verse 1]
he was choking back the tears
as he tried to tell his wife
that the job he'd had for years
he'd worked hard all his life
that everything went south
and he couldn't meet the bills
and he had to sell the house
that his daddy built
[refrain 1]
and he'd ask how such a thing could be happening
but he was sure there was nobody listening
[verse 2]
in the gulf of mexico
near the town of new orleans
where all the tourists go
in this land of hopes and dreams
then there came a killer storm
a devastating flood
and the people they were warned
that it would turn their streets to mud
[refrain 2]
sure enough that storm took everything
and it was like there was nobody listening
in these days of change and mass communication
seems like no one's plugged into the sounds of desperation
and they say the future's just an extension of the past
and history has knack of comin' back
[verse 3]
now the writer takes his pen
and he tries to find the words
though time and time again
they often go unheard
and the singer sings his song
and he tries to impart
all the troubles goin' on
weighin' heavy on his heart
but what good is the song that he has to sing
when nobody's listening
but I know why he has to try to sing
'cause he believes that somebody's listening
[intro toots]

time goes by so slowly
and time can do so much
are you still mine

and time can do so much
are you still mine

i had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
well you may say "how" but you don't know me
i've taken my licks and I'm paying my fee
i had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
[verse 1]
been ridin' my mind 'round my neighborhood
gettin' 'nowhere slow but I'm feeling good
stayed up all night that's when I'm at my best
sleep all day and that's too much rest
had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
you may say "how" but you don't know me
i've taken my licks and I'm paying my fee
i had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
[verse 2]
i went crazy one day but I came back when
i caught myself goin' crazy again
i decided to write the world's best song
but when I got around to it it had done moved on
had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
well you may say "how" but you don't know me
i've taken my licks and I'm a-paying my fee
i had the seven-year itch scratched it out in three
[verse 1]
stay away from lonely places
just follow the crowd
and stay around familiar faces
play the music loud
be seen at all the parties
and dress yourself with style
and stay away from lonely places for awhile
[verse 2]
stay away from lonely places
'til you learn to live alone
and someone's outstretched arms are waiting
to stay with you at least 'til dawn
and remember that sorrow prospers
in a heart that never smiles
so stay away from lonely places for awhile
[verse 2]
stay away from lonely places
it takes time to learn to live alone
and someone's outstretched arms are waiting
to stay with you at least 'til dawn
and remember that sorrow prospers
in a heart that never smiles
so stay away from lonely places for awhile
the winners tell jokes and the losers say "deal"
lady luck rides a stallion tonight
and she smiles at the winners and she laughs at the losers
and the losers say "that just ain't right"
but they keep right on playing and paying and praying
that someday their luck just might change
and if you're surveying the table and you're looking for the sucker
oh by the way sir what is your name
lady luck rides a stallion tonight
lady luck rides a stallion tonight
she smiles on the winners and laughs at the losers

one more wager winner take all
'cause sweet lady luck likes me a lot more than you
and I'm bettin' she'll come when I call

she smiles on the winners and she laughs at the losers
lady luck rides a stallion tonight
when the loser has no more to bet
and the winner's won all he can get
lady luck will go riding off in the moonlight
lady luck rides a stallion tonight
lady luck rides a stallion tonight

now very far from me there's an old holler tree
where you lay down a dollar or two
you go round the bend and you come back again
with a jug of that good ol' mountain dew
they call it that old mountain dew lord-lord and them that refuse it are few
i'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good old mountain dew
[verse 2]
the preacher came by with his head high said hi said his wife took down with the flu
and he thought that we're hard just to give him a quart
of that good old mountain dew
well they call it that old mountain dew lord-lord and them that refuse it are few
i'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good old mountain dew
[verse 3]
my uncle mort he's sawed off and he's short he measures 'bout four foot two
but he thinks he's a giant when you give him a pint of that good old mountain dew
well they call it that old mountain dew lord-lord and them that refuse it are few
i'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good old mountain dew
i'll hush up my mug if you'll fill up my jug with that good old mountain dew
[verse 1]
tonight in a bar alone
i'm sitting apart from
the laughter and the cheer
scenes from the past
rise before me while
watching the bubbles in my beer
[verse 2]
visions of someone
who loved me brings
along salty tears to my eyes
and I know that my life's
been a failure
watching the bubbles in my beer
[verse 3]
i'm seeing the road
that I've travelled
a road paved
with heartaches and tears
and I'm seeing the past
that I've wasted
watching the bubbles in my beer
[verse 1]
here you are back on my mind where you stay quite a lot
bringing back all the old memories I thought I'd forgot
i just keep finding you with me and I don't know why
maybe I should've been listening when you said goodbye
[verse 2]
i can't believe how you keep hanging on to my mind
now I know leaving means one goes and one stays behind
i can't escape from you no matter how hard I try
maybe I should've been listening when you said goodbye
[verse 3]
maybe I should've been watching when you walked away
maybe you wouldn't keep turning up day after day
if I'd paid attention I'd known that you didn't lie
maybe I should've been listening when you said goodbye
maybe I should have been listening when you said goodbye
[verse 1]
i can have a mansion that's higher than the trees
i could have all the gifts I want and never ask please
and I could fly to paris oh that's at my beck and call
so why do I go through life with nothing at all
but when I dream I dream of you
maybe someday it will come true
[verse 2]
i can be the singer or the clown in every room
i can even call someone to take me to the moon
i can put my makeup on and drive the crowds insane
i can go to bed alone and never know her name
midnight run down a cold dark road
a load of moonshine on a flatbed ford
the headlights off and the coast is clear
grab that wheel let go the fear
on a midnight run
well there might be trouble cause everybodys got a gun
across that county line
with fifty more cases white lightning apple moonshine
fight for love fight for life
fight for money with the edge of a knife
rule your fear and rule the night
rule the road in a lawless fight
bullets flying through my daddy's door
now you know my daddy didn't want this war
but if they're looking for trouble they're in the right place
cause them back wood boys will spit in your face
on a midnight run
well there might be trouble cause everybodys got a gun
across that county line
i got fifty more cases of white lightning apple moonshine
won't you ride in my little red wagon
i'd love to pull you down the street
and I know all the kids will be jealous
when they see my playmate so sweet
hold tight 'til we come to the hilltop
going to coast down the hill you and me
won't you ride in my little red wagon
for you are my sweetheart-to-be
hold tight 'til we come to the hilltop
going to coast down the hill you and me
won't you ride in my little red wagon
for you are my sweetheart-to-be
i have seen the morning burning golden on the mountain in the skies
aching with the feeling of the freedom of an eagle when she flies
turning on the world the way she smiled upon my soul as I lay dying
healing as the colors in the sunshine and the shadows of her eyes
waking in the morning to the feeling of her fingers on my skin
wiping out the traces of the people and the places that I've been
teaching me that yesterday was something that I'd never thought of trying
talking of tomorrow and the money love and time we have to spend
loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
coming close together with a feeling that I've never known before in my time
she isn't ashamed to be a woman or afraid to be a friend
i don't know the answers to the easy way she opened every door in my mind
but dreaming was as easy as believing it was never going to end
and loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
coming close together[]
loving her was easier than anything I'll ever do again
[verse 1]
twilight falls evening shadows find
there beneath the stars a maiden so fair divine
lonely there she kneels and tells the stars above
in her heart is a song and there it belongs
her undying song of love
[verse 2]
every word reveals an empty broken heart
broken by fate that held them so far apart
stars on high seem to know she's there
[verse 1]
i'm getting tired now
i gotta get some sleep now
guess I've been worried much too long
and don't wake me 'til it's over
when the need for you is gone
[verse 2]
i was so happy before I loved you
i want to be like I was before
and don't wake me 'til it's over
when I won't want you anymore
my eyes are getting weak now
i gotta get some sleep now
i gotta rest my aching head
i just want to lay here
just let me stay here
'til the blues get up and leave my bed
good night darling good night darling
good night forevermore
and don't wake me 'til it's over
when I won't love you anymore
my eyes are getting weak now
i gotta get some sleep now
i got to rest my aching head
i just want to lay here
just let me stay here
'til the blues get up and leave my bed
good night darling good night darling
good night forevermore
and don't wake me 'til it's over
and you're sure that I don't love you anymore
[verse 1]
papa's words ringing in my ears
son you got to get tighter with your tears
just because she's leaving don't start believing
that your rock-n-roll days are gone
'cause nothing lasts forever but old fords and a natural stone
[verse 2]
and when those sad songs and slow hurting songs
get you down while you're alone it won't hurt long
'cause nothing lasts forever like old fords and a natural stone
[verse 3]
diamonds are forever and these old cars they still keep rollin' on
and all those "i love you forever's" they're just words that can't be depended on
because when they're wrong they're wrong
and when they're gone they're gone
'cause nothing lasts forever but old fords or a natural stone
papa's words ringing in my ears
son you got to get tighter with your tears
valentine won't you be my valentine
and introduce your heart to mine and be my valentine
summertime we could run and play like summertime
with storybooks and nursery rhymes so be my valentine
candy heart if anyone could you could have a candy heart
you're the sweetest of all sweethearts won't you give your heart to me
can't you see
i love you valentine won't you be my valentine
and won't you share your space with mine and be my valentine
[verse 1]
you won't catch me crying over you
i think I'm leaving after all I've been through
pardon me if I love you endlessly
but you've got wounds that I can't move
i won't be not sleeping over you
if I'm sleeping far away from you
i know you think you need me
but once you had and couldn't keep me
isn't this the same ground we've been through
you won't catch me crying over you
won't catch me crying
won't catch me crying over you
[verse 2]
you won't catch me crying over you
after all the things you put me through
i need to be somewhere with room to breathe
i need a heart that don't need you
you won't catch me crying over you
won't catch me crying
won't catch me crying over you
[verse 3]
you won't catch me crying over you
after all this work you gave me to do
pardon me if I love you endlessly
but you've got wounds that I can't move
you won't catch me crying over you
you won't catch me crying
you won't catch me crying
you won't catch me crying over you
[verse 1]
well I can't read your mind
when you change it all the time
and I don't what's matter with you
i think I do my share to show that I care
so just tell me what do you want me to do
[verse 2]
i've tried to be kind but it don't work sometimes
and you're not the same person that I knew
and tell me where should I start to return to your heart
and tell me what do you want me to do
[verse 3]
what do you want me to do with the dreams that I own
should I changed them to memories and leave you alone
maybe I'm not too smart I guess you know me by heart
and if my chances of winning are few
let my heart step aside with what's left of my pride
and tell me what do you want me to do
tell me what do you want me to do
[verse 1]
you tell me today that you're leaving
but just think a while
i'm sure that you must know
today might be the day that you walk away
but you left me a long long time ago
[verse 2]
today's just the day that ends it all
except the usual memories
that always linger on
today might be the day that you walk away
but you left me a long long time ago
[verse 3]
i stood with helpless hands and watched me lose your love
a little more each day then it was gone
and I kept wondering
just how long until this day would come
just how long could your pride keep hanging on
so please don't say you're sorry
don't say anything
don't try to say why you must leave just go
today might be the day that you walk away
but you left me a long long time ago
you left me a long long time ago
fly me to the moon
and let me play among the stars
and let me know what spring is like
on jupiter and mars
in other words hold my hand
in other words darling kiss me
fill my heart with song
and let me sing forever more
you are all I long for
all I worship and adore
in other words please be true
in other words I love you
fly me to the moon
and let me play among the stars
and let me know what spring is like
on jupiter and mars
in other words hold my hand
in other words darling kiss me
deep within my heart lies a melody
a song of old san antone
where in dreams I live with a memory
beneath the stars all alone
'cause it was there I found beside the alamo
enchantment strange as the blue up above
and that moonlit pass beside the alamo
and rose my rose in san antone
moon and all your splendor knows only my heart
call back my rose rose of san antone
lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
speak once again of my love my own
broken song and empty words I know
still live in my heart all alone
and that moonlit pass beside the alamo
and rose my rose of san antone
[instrumental bridge]
well now moon and all your splendor knows only my heart
call back my rose rose of san antone
lips so sweet and tender like petals falling apart
speak once again of my love my own
broken song and empty words I know
still live in my heart all alone
and that moonlit pass by the alamo
and rose my rose of san antone
rose my rose of san antone
rose my rose of san antone
[verse 1]
don't be concerned 'cause it's time I learned
that those who play with fire get burned
but I'll be alright in a little while
but you'll be permanently lonely
[verse 2]
and don't be too quick to pity me
don't salve my heart with sympathy
because I'll be alright in a little while
but you'll be permanently lonely
[verse 3]
the world looks on with wonder and pity at your kind
because it knows that the future is not very pretty for your kind
for your kind will always be running and wondering
what's happened to hearts that you've broken and left all alone
but we'll be alright in a little while but you'll be permanently lonely
running lonely
[verse 1]
heartache number one was when you left me
i never knew that I could hurt this way
and heartache number two was when you came back again
you came back and never meant to stay
now I've got heartaches by the number trouble by the score
every day you love me less each day I love you more
yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
but the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
heartache number three was when you called me
and said that you were coming back to stay
with hopeful heart I waited for your knock on the door
i waited but you must have lost your way
now I've got heartaches by the number trouble by the score
every day you love me less each day I love you more
yes I've got heartaches by the number a love that I can't win
but the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
and the day that I stop counting that's the day my world will end
[verse 1]
touch me
touch the hand of the man who once owned all the world
touch me
touch the arms that once held all the charms of the world's sweetest girl
touch me
maybe someday you may need to know how it feels when you lose
so touch me
and you will know how you'd feel with the blues
[verse 2]
watch me
watch the eyes that have seen all the heartbreak and pain in the land
and be thankful
that you're happy though standing so close to the world's bluest man
don't forget me
take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
then touch me
and you'll know how you'd feel with the blues
don't forget me
take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
then touch me
and you'll know how you'd feel with the blues
[sister's coming home]
[verse 1]
my sister's coming home
mama's going to let her sleep whole day long
well oh the whole day long
my sister's coming home
mama's going to let her sleep whole day long
[verse 2]
my sister's coming home
mama don't like the man that done her wrong
well oh that done her wrong

[guitar and fiddle solos]
[verse 1]
my sister's coming home

the mirror's going to tell her just how long she's been gone

[verse 1]

dancing through the rock and roll
sister likes to do it
lord sister likes to move her soul

pretend I never happened
erase me from your mind
you will not want to remember
any love as cold as mine
[verse 1]
i'll be leaving in the morning
for a place I hope I find
all the places must be better
than the ones I leave behind
[chorus 2]
i don't suppose you'll be unhappy
you'll find ways to spend your time
but if you ever think about me
and if I ever cross your mind
[chorus 1]
pretend I never happened
erase me from your mind
you will not want to remember

any love as cold as mine
you will not want to remember
any love as cold as mine
it's not the pale moon that excites me
that thrills and delights me oh no
it's just the nearness of you
it's not your sweet conversation
that brings this sensation oh no
it's just the nearness of you
when you're in my arms
and I feel you so close to me
all my wildest dreams come true
i need no soft lights to enchant me
if you'll only grant me the right
to hold you ever so tight
and to feel in the night
the nearness of you
when you're in my arms
and I feel you so close to me
all my wildest dreams come true
missed the saturday dance
heard they crowded the floor
couldn't bear it without you
don't get around much anymore
thought I'd visit the club
got as far as the door
they'd have asked me about you
don't get around much anymore
darling I guess my mind's more at ease
but nevertheless why stir up memories
been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
awfully different without you don't get around much anymore
darling I guess my mind's more at ease
but nevertheless why stir up memories
been invited on dates
might have gone but what for
awfully different without you don't get around much anymore
[verse 1]
i thought about trees
and how much I'd like to climb one
i thought about friends
and how rare it is to find one
i thought about you
the most gentle sweet and kind one
i thought about you lord
i thought about you
i thought about life
and the way that things are going
i thought about love
and the pain there is in growing
and I thought about you
the one who is all knowing
i thought about you lord
i thought about you
i thought about you
and the songs that I keep singing
i thought about you
and the joy that they keep bringing
i thought about life
and a love that has no ending
i thought about you lord
i thought about you
i thought about you lord
i thought about you
[verse 1]
precious memories unseen angels
sent from somewhere to my soul
how they linger ever near me
and the sacred scenes unfold
precious memories how they linger
how they ever flood my soul
in the stillness of the midnight
precious sacred scenes unfold
[verse 2]
precious father loving mother
fly across the lonely years
and old home scenes of my childhood
in fond memory appear
[verse 3]
in the stillness of the midnight
echoes from the past I hear
old-time singing gladness bringing
from that lovely land somewhere
[verse 4]
i remember mother praying
father too on bended knee
sun is sinking shadows falling
but their prayers still follow me
i could tell the moment that I saw him
he was nothing but the trouble making kind
his hair was much too long and his motley group of friends
had nothing but rebellion on their minds
he's rejected the establishment completely
i know for sure he's never held a job
he just goes from town to town stirring up the young folks
till they're nothing but a disrespectful mob
i know for sure he's never joined the army
and served his country like we all have done
he'd rather wear his sandals and his flowers
while others wage the war that must be won
they arrested him last week and found him guilty
and sentenced him to die but that's no great loss
friday they will take him to a place called calvary
and hang that troublemaker to a cross
[verse 1]
well I woke up sunday morning
with no way to hold my head that didn't hurt
and the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
so I had one more for dessert
then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
and found my cleanest dirty shirt
then I washed my face and combed my hair
and stumbled down the stairs to meet the day
[verse 2]
i'd smoked my mind the night before
with cigarettes and songs I'd been picking
but I lit my first and watched a small kid
playing with a can that he was kicking
then I walked across the street
and caught the sunday smell of someone frying chicken
and lord it took me back to something that I'd lost
somewhere somehow along the way
on a sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord that I was stoned
'cause there's something in a sunday
that makes a body feel alone
and there's nothing short a' dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalk
and sunday morning coming down
[verse 3]
in the park I saw a daddy
with a laughing little girl that he was swinging
and I stopped beside a sunday school
and listened to the songs they were singing
then I headed down the street
and somewhere far away a lonely bell was ringing
and it echoed through the canyon
like the disappearing dreams of yesterday
on a sunday morning sidewalk
i'm wishing lord that I was stoned
'cause there's something in a sunday
that makes a body feel alone
and there's nothing short a' dying
that's half as lonesome as the sound
of the sleeping city sidewalk
and sunday morning coming down
there's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland
and the bankers are taking my home and my land from me
there's a big aching hole in my chest now where my heart was
and a hole in the sky where god used to be
there's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland
there's a well where the water's so bitter nobody can drink
ain't no way to get high and my mouth is so dry that I can't speak
don't they know that I'm dying why's nobody crying for me
my american dream fell apart at the seams
you tell me what it means you tell me what it means
there's a home place under fire tonight in a heartland
and bankers are taking the homes and the land away
there's a young boy closing his eyes tonight in a heartland
who will wake up a man with some land and a loan he can't pay
his american dream fell apart at the seams
you tell me what it means you tell me what it means
my american dream
there's a home place under fire tonight in the heartland [x4]
for you
there'll be no more cryin'
for you
the sun will be shinin'
and I feel that when I'm with you it's alright
i know its right
to you
i'll give the world
to you
i'll never be cold
'cause I feel when I'm with yu its alright
i know its right
and the songbirds are singing
like they know the score
and I love you I love you I love you
like never before
and I wish you all the love in the world
but most of all I wish it for myself
and the songbirds keep singing
like they know the score
and I love I love you I love you
like never before
and I love you I love you I love you
like never before
[verse 1]
south of the border down mexico way
that's where I fell in love when stars above came out to play
now as I wander my thoughts ever stray
south of the border down mexico way
[verse 2]
she was a picture in old spanish lace
and for a tender while I kissed the smile upon her face
for it was fiesta we were so gay
south of the border down mexico way
[verse 3]
and she smiled and she whispered "manana"
never dreaming that we were parting
and I lied as I whispered "manana"
for our tomorrow never came
south of the border I rode back one day
there in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
and the mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
south of the border down mexico way
climb aboard a butterfly
and take off on the breeze
let your worries flutter by
and do the things you please
in a land where dollar bills
are falling off the trees
on a dreamer's holiday
every day for breakfast
there's a dish of scrambled stars
and for lunching you'll be munching
rainbow candy bars
you'll be living a la mode
on jupiter and mars
on a dreamer's holiday
make it a long vacation
time there is plenty of
you need no reservation
just bring along the one you love
help yourself to happiness
and sprinkle it with mirth
close your eyes and concentrate
and dream for all you're worth
you will feel terrific
when you get back down to earth
from a dreamer's holiday
make it a long vacation
time there is plenty of
you need no reservation
just bring along the one you love
help yourself to happiness
and sprinkle it with mirth
close your eyes and concentrate
and dream for all you're worth
you will feel terrific
when you get back down to earth
from a dreamer's holiday
from a dreamer's holiday
if the world keeps on turning and I know that it is true
then I'll keep on loving you
and if the stars stay in heaven and the moon stays in the blue
then I'll keep on loving you
what the thing changes sky to fall the dawn wouldn't come the world wouldn't stall
i wouldn't care as long as you're near it wouldn't matter to me at all
and if the stars stay in heaven and the moon stays in the blue
then I'll keep on loving you
if the world keeps on turning and I know that bound to do
then I'll keep on loving you
and if the stars stay in heaven and I know that it is true
what the thing changes sky to fall the dawn wouldn't come the world wouldn't stall
i wouldn't care as long as you're near it wouldn't matter to me at all
and if the stars stay in heaven and the moon stays in the blue
then I'll keep on loving you
i peeped in to say good night
and then I heard my child in prayer
and for me some scarlet ribbons
scarlet ribbons for my hair
all the stores were closed and shuttered
all the streets were dark and bare
and in our town no scarlet ribbons
not one ribbon for her hair
through the night my heart was aching
just before the dawn was breaking
i peeped in and on her bed
in gay profusion lying there
lovely ribbons scarlet ribbons
scarlet ribbons for her hair
if I live to be two hundred
i will never know from where
came those lovely scarlet ribbons
scarlet ribbons for her hair
if I live to be two hundred
i will never know from where
came those lovely scarlet ribbons
scarlet ribbons for her hair
[verse 1]
that's my favorite part
rewind my life on
when my world got dark
you turned my light on
i watched it for hours again and again in my head
i did
i see I was down on you more than I needed to be
i'd say I'm sorry but then you'd think I'm lying
maria shut up and kiss me
stop shaking stand up and hold me
i bet you're gonna miss me
you need me believe me
maria shut up and kiss me
you're crazy and it turns me on and on
the way you're carrying on
[verse 2]
that's my favorite shirt
you always had on
and it sure looked good
every time you walked on
you're taking the wind from me every chance that you could
you're good
something I can't explain
you tell me lately I've changed
if you feel better tell me why are you crying
maria shut up and kiss me
stop shaking stand up and hold me
i bet you're gonna miss me
you need me believe me
maria shut up and kiss me
you're crazy and it turns me on and on
the way you're carrying on
[verse 3]
maria maria can we talk it over instead
let's call it even and leave it alone
come to bed
maria stop leaving your teasing is beaten me down
maria just calm down
in these situations I've found
it's best not to be proud
and say that you're sorry
maria shut up and kiss me
stop shaking stand up and hold me
i bet you're gonna miss me
you need me believe me
maria shut up and kiss me
you're crazy and it turns me on and on
the way you're carrying on
and it turns me on and on
on and on
on and on
on and on and on and on
never think evil thoughts of anyone
it's just as wrong to think as to say
for a thought is but a word that's unspoken
in god's eyes he sees it this way
lend a hand if you can to a stranger
never worry if he can't repay
for in time you'll be repaid ten times over
in god's eyes he sees it this way
in god's eyes we're like sheep in a meadow
now and then a lamb goes astray
but open arms should await it's returning
in god's eyes he sees it this way
where is our hero tonight
the bars are all booming
and he's nowhere in sight
wherever he is lord we hope he's alright
where is our hero tonight
[verse 1]
he used to be king of the bars
he's opened and closed them from waco to mars
now he sings on the streets and he sleeps in his car
but he used to be king of the bars
where is our hero tonight
he left here a-sailing he was high as a kite
feeling kinda sorry and looking for a fight
where is our hero tonight
and where is our hero today
can we just tag along we'll stay out his way
does he still write the sad songs and can he still play
where is our hero today
wherever he is lord we hope he's alright
but where is our hero tonight
[verse 1]

sometimes heaven and sometimes hell
sometimes I don't even know
sometimes I take it as far as I can
and sometimes I don't even go
my front tracks're headed for a cold water well
my back tracks're covered with snow
but sometimes heaven sometimes hell
and sometimes I don't even know
[verse 2]
heaven ain't walking
on a street paved with gold
hell ain't a mountain of fire
heaven is laying
in my sweet baby's arms
and hell is when baby ain't there
well my front tracks're headed for a cold water well
and my back tracks're covered with snow
well sometimes heaven sometimes hell
and sometimes I don't even know
sometimes heaven and sometimes hell
and sometimes I don't even know
i'm falling in love again
i never thought I would again
i never I thought I would
and I may be making mistakes again
but if I lose or win
how will I know

if it's wrong to love you wrong I'll always be
and though the world may scorn me darling can't you see
if it's wrong to want you when my day is through
gladly I will pay for all my dreams of you
and though we met too late dear and you'll never know
that without a right to I have loved you so
i can't change my heart now you're a part of me
so if it's wrong to love you wrong I'll always be

well it's 4 am ain't no sleep to be found
your face in my mind spinning around
and awake I will dream in my dream you'll be there
and I can't get away from you anywhere
and ever since I met you my life's been a song
a sad song a love song with hate in between
you'd be breaking my heart it was clear from the start
but my pen and my paper will keep my mind clean
and I can't breathe when you're around
my heart doesn't beat my mouth doesn't speak
and I can't sleep cause of the sound
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down
[verse 2]
and I can't see myself without seeing you
i can't touch anything that don't feel like you do
any place that I go I'll be looking for you
and it hurts me to know that you don't love me too
and I can't breathe when you're around
my heart doesn't beat my mouth doesn't speak
and I can't sleep cause of the sound
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down
and I can't breathe when you're around
my heart doesn't beat my mouth doesn't speak
and I can't sleep cause of the sound
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down
the sound of your memory that's bringing me down

and wished that I was dead

i can see clearly now the rain is gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
it is going to a be a bright bright bright bright
sun-shiny day
i think I can make it now the pain is gone
all of the bad feelings have disappeared
here is the rainbow I have been praying for
its going to be a bright bright bright bright
sun-shiny day
look all around there is nothing but blue skies
look straight ahead nothing but blue skies
i can see clearly now the rain is gone
i can see all obstacles in my way
gone are the dark clouds that had me blind
it is going to a be a bright bright bright bright
sun-shiny day

blow her a kiss from across the room
say she looks nice when she's not
touch her hand as she pass her chair
little things mean a lot
give her your arm as you cross the street
call her at six on the dot
align a day when you're far away
little things mean a lot
don't have to buy her diamonds and pearls
champagne sables and stuffs
she doesn't care much for diamonds and pearls
she'll laugh and say "honey they just cost money"
so give her your hand when she's lost the way
and give her your shoulder to cry on
whether the day is sunny or gray
give her your heart to rely on
[verse 2]
send her the warmth of a secret smile
to show her you haven't forgot
that always and ever for now and forever
little things mean a lot
so give her your hand when she's lost the way
and give her your shoulder to cry on
whether the day is sunny or gray
give her your heart to rely on

send her the warmth of a secret smile
to show her you haven't forgot
that always and ever for now and forever

oh oh it’s cold outside
and the hardest part is i
can’t take away the chill in the night
and i’ve been pining on and on
how everything is wrong
as if to throw away everything I own
and the weather changed again
but the city looks the same
though I can’t find the sun
from the chill in the air
be that as it may i’ve fallen on better days
be that as it may i’ve fallen on better days
[verse 2]
nowhere is a place
somewhere hidden in the face
of every dream i’ve had that doesn’t quite exist
it doesn’t pay to blink
cause it’s later than you think
you’re whole life could change with or without me
a promise is a lie
with a prettier disguise
like i’ll love you
for the rest of my life
[verse 3]
six o’clock in the morning and here I am
morning without warning once again
so i’m playing it cool
i’m playing it down cause it’s easier on me
all the way around
and I don’t wanna say goodbye
but i’m tired of this and i
i’m running out of time
i’d fly if only I could fly
but I barely walk this time i’m running out of time
it feels like dying I feel like crying
i'm running out of time
[verse 1]
i think I should speak to you stranger
your problem is clear now to me
you think that the whole world's against you
and you tell everyone that you see
just suffer in silence speak no bitter words
the world offers no sympathy
though trouble surrounds you and you long to be heard
just suffer in silence like me
[verse 2]
i'll give you a lesson in living
and I hope it stays with you a while
you're the reason for all of your sorrows
so just suffer in silence and smile
just suffer in silence speak no bitter words
the world offers no sympathy
though trouble surrounds you and you long to be heard
just suffer in silence like me
i love you I'll prove it in days to come
i swear it's true darling you're the only one
i've been so blue and lonesome since you've gone
i love you I'll prove it a thousand ways
i'll be nice and sweet to you and no more will you be blue
i'll prove I love you every day all kinds of ways
so darling please wait please wait until I'm free
there'll be a change a great change made in me
i love you and there'll never be blue days
i love you and I'll prove it a thousand ways
i'll be nice and sweet to you
[verse 1 emmylou harris]
angel eyes angel eyes
the ways of the world are feeble
don't give up on simple people
angel eyes stun those nights
the blues you can live without
it's not what your song's about
[chorus emmylou harris & willie nelson]
angel eyes angel eyes
tell me what would we do without
the light from angel eyes
[verse 2 willie nelson both]
you can move the hearts of men
just with a phrase you're turning
since hearts ever after burning
bear with love bear so alone
thin lines you've been living on
are so close to the danger zone
[chorus emmylou harris & willie nelson]
angel eyes angel eyes
tell me what would we do without
the light from angel eyes
[verse 1]
i was standing by my window
on one cold and cloudy day
when I saw that hearse come rolling
for to carry my mother away
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
[verse 2]
i said to that undertaker
undertaker please drive slow
for this lady you are carrying
lord I hate to see here go
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
[verse 3]
oh I followed close behind her
tried to hold up and be brave
but I could not hide my sorrow
when they laid her in the grave
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
[verse 4]
i went back home my home was lonesome
missed my mother she was gone
all of my brothers sisters crying
what a home so sad and lone
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
[verse 5]
we sang the songs of childhood
hymns of faith that made us strong
ones that mother maybelle taught us
hear the angels sing along
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
will the circle be unbroken
by and by lord by and by
there's a better home a-waiting
in the sky lord in the sky
[verse 1]
cyrus jones 1810 to 1913
made his great grandchildren believe
he could live to a 103
a hundred and three is forever when you're just a little kid
so cyrus jones lived forever
when you dig my grave
could you make it shallow
so that I can feel the rain
[verse 2]
muriel stonewall 1903 to 1954
she lost both of her babies in the second great war
now you should never have to watch your only children lowered in the ground
that means you should never have to bury your own babies
when you dig my grave
could you make it shallow
so that I can feel the rain
ring around the rosey
pocket full o'posey
ashes to ashes
we all fall down
[verse 3]
little mikey carson '67 to '75
he rode his bike like the devil until the day he died
when he grows up he wants to be mr vertigo on the flying trapeze
oh 1940 to 1992
when you dig my grave
could you make it shallow
so that I can feel the rain
[verse 1]
if you can't say you love me say you hate me
and that you regret each time you held me tight
if you can't be mine forever then forsake me
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
[verse 2]
it was right when you loved me only
but wrong when you held another tight
so before you go away and leave me lonely
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
so please help me face the new tomorrows
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
[instrumental break]
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
so please help me face the new tomorrows
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
[verse 1]
frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul
with a corncob pipe and a button nose
and two eyes made out of coal
frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
he was made of snow but the children
know how he came to life one day
there must have been some magic in that
old silk hat they found
for when they placed it on his head
he began to dance around
o frosty the snowman
was alive as he could be
and the children say he could laugh
and play just the same as you and me
thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
look at frosty go
thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
over the hills of snow
[verse 2]
frosty the snowman knew
the sun was hot that day
so he said "let's run and
we'll have some fun
now before I melt away"
down to the village
with a broomstick in his hand
running here and there all
around the square saying
catch me if you can
he led them down the streets of town
right to the traffic cop
and he only paused a moment when
he heard him holler "stop"
for frosty the snow man
had to hurry on his way
but he waved goodbye saying
"don't you cry
i'll be back again some day"
thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
look at frosty go
thumpetty thump thump
thumpety thump thump
over the hills of snow
the thrill is gone the thrill is gone away
the thrill is gone the thrill is gone away
you know you done me wrong
and you'll be sorry someday
[verse 1 bb king]
thrill is gone gone away from me
thrill is gone gone away from me
although I'll still live on
oh so lonely I'll be
[verse 2 willie nelson]
you know I'm free from you baby
i am free from your spell
well I'm free free free from you
i'm free from your spell
now that it's all over
all I can do is wish you well
[chorus both]
the thrill is gone the thrill is gone away
the thrill is gone the thrill is gone away
you know you done me wrong
and you'll be sorry someday
[verse 1]
somebody pick up my pieces I'm scattered everywhere
and put me back together and put me way over there
take me out of contention I surrender my crown
so somebody pick up my pieces it's just me coming down
[verse 2]
well I sure thought I had her lord I know she had me
but what I thought was heaven is just falling debris
well I may not be crazy but I got one hell of a start
somebody pick up my pieces I think I'm falling apart
and don't follow my footsteps step over my trail
the road is too narrow and your footing could fail
and the fall to the bottom could tear you apart
and they'll be picking up pieces of you and your heart
[instrumental break]
and don't follow my footsteps step over my trail
the road is too narrow and your footing could fail
and the fall to the bottom could tear you apart
and they'll be picking up pieces of you and your heart
and they'll be picking up pieces of you and your heart
[verse 1]
you make my eyes run over all the time
and you're happy when I'm out of my mind
you don't love me but you won't let me be
don't you ever get tired of hurting me
[verse 2]
you must think that I look bad with a smile
for you haven't let me have one in such a long long while
still I keep running back how can this be
don't you ever get tired of hurting me
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
you must think that I look bad with a smile
for you haven't let me have one in such a long long while
still I keep running back how can this be
don't you ever get tired of hurting me
don't you ever get tired of hurting me
[verse 1]
some people are saying that time will take care of people like me
then I'm living too fast and they say I can't last too much longer
but little they see that their thoughts of me is my savior
and they really should know that the beat ought to go just a little faster
so pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
the singer ain't singing and the drummer's been dragging too long
time will take care of itself so just leave time alone
and pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
[verse 2]
well I'm wild and I'm mean and I'm creating a scene I'm going crazy
well I'm good and I'm bad and I'm happy and I'm sad and I'm lazy
well I'm quiet and I'm loud and I'm gathering a crowd and I like gravy
about half off the wall but I learned it all in the navy
[verse 1]
you were it
you're the one the only one who understood it all
and when we fought out loud
you'd be the one who would make me feel so small
[chorus 1]
you could kill
you could hurt
you could bring out the worst in everyone you knew
but no one could ever bring the worst out of you
[chorus 2]
and I am fine
all the pain is gone
i once had a heart
now I have a song
[verse 2]
and you were sly
you were fast
you were built to last
and you lasted 'til the end
and I would fight
i would cry and lay down and die
and then get up again
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2][3x]
[verse 1]
the road ain't getting shorter
and I think the weed is getting stronger
and I'm trying not to speak
to no one who don't care
i'm spinning around in a whirlpool of letters
that run in a circle and try to break free in my mind
and I know I'm still young
but I can only get older
and I know that sometimes
i hurt you and I'm gone
well it's a story as old as the fire that brought us together
you think that we'd learn but you still remain
in the back of my mind
eating up all my time
hanging weightless in the sky
like an angel with no place to fly
[verse 2]
everyday I get stoned
i simply try to write a song
the road is like a river
that sings when I'm alone
i'm sitting beside a window of light
that floods in my eyes and keeps me from finding mine
if I stayed home
i'd only wish I was gone
wanting you with me
but knowing that you can't come
you've seen all the charms of this crazy old life
and you'd just as soon leave 'em behind as you'd never leave me
looking for some peace of mind
like an angel with no place to fly
whenever we kiss I worry and wonder
your lips may be here but where is your heart
it's always like this I worry and wonder
you're close to me here but where is your heart
it's a sad thing to realize that you've got a heart that never melts
when we kiss do you close your eyes pretending that I'm someone else
you must break the spell this cloud that I'm under
so please won't you tell me darling where is your heart
it's a sad thing to realize that you've got a heart that never melts
when we kiss do you close your eyes pretending that I'm someone else
you must break the spell this cloud that I'm under
so please won't you tell me darling where is your heart
you always hurt the one you love
the one you shouldn't hurt at all
you always take the sweetest rose
and crush it until the petals fall
you always break the kindest heart
with a hasty word you can't recall
so if I broke your heart last night
it's because I love you most of all
you are the promised kiss of springtime
that makes the lonely winter seem long
you are the breathless hush of evening
that trembles on the brink of a lovely song
you are the angel glow that lights a star
the dearest things I know are what you are
some day my happy arms will hold you
and some day I'll know that moment divine
when all the things you are are mine
i had a dog and his name was blue
i'll tell you what old blue would do
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
he'd go out every night about dark
and it wouldn't be long 'til you'd hear him bark
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
and I'd go out to see what he had
it'd be a great big opossum up a black-jack tree
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
i'd get a stick and I'd knock him down
i'm gong to bake that opossum good and brown
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
ol' blue he died and he died so hard
that he graveled little holes all over the yard
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
i dug his grave with a silver spade
and I lowered him down with a golden chain
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
and when I get to heaven I'll tell you what I'll do
i'm gonna get my horn and call ol' blue
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
yeah blue yeah blue yeah blue
there's a story the gypsies know is true
that when your love wears golden earrings
she belongs to you
an old love story that's known to very few
but if you wear those golden earrings
love will come to you
by the burning fire they will glow with every coal
you will hear desire whisper low inside your soul
so be my gypsy
make love your guiding light
and let this pair of golden earrings
cast their spell tonight
by the burning fire they will glow with every coal
you will hear desire whisper low inside your soul
so be my gypsy
make love your guiding light
and let this pair of golden earrings
cast their spell tonight
[verse 1]
a short time I have to be with you my love
but a short time is better than no time you see
so I bring to you all my possessions
and would let you share them with me
[verse 2]
i bring you one springtime of robins
one springtime of robins to sing
i bring you one summer of roses
one summer of roses I bring
[verse 3]
i bring you one autumn dry leaves
dry leaves will be helpful you know
to soften the fall of your snowflakes
when I bring you your winter of snow
[verse 1]
it's quarter to three there's no one in the place except you and me
so set 'em up joe I've got a little story you ought to know
we're drinking my friend to the end of a brief episode
just give me one for my baby and one more for the road
[verse 2]
i've got the routine so drop another nickel in the machine
i'm feeling so bad I wish you'd make the music dreamy and sad
i could tell you a lot but you've got to be true to your code
so give me one for my baby and one more for the road
just give me one for my baby and one more for the road
[verse 1]
she's like a beautiful lady with a mona lisa smile dallas
and she can charm you in her own texas style dallas
would you believe she named her airport love
just to symbol pf what she's got plenty of
she's a city with a mind of her own my own dallas
[verse 2]
take a ride on her central expressway breeze down the lbj
look her over good and you'll have to say
she's the best dressed city in the usa I love my city of soul
from demons lace to the cotton bowl
from highland park to harold square
she swings like a blonde with a millionaire
[verse 3]
and you can bet I never stay away for very long from dallas
'cause like baby misses mama on his first night from home I miss dallas
she's a beautiful queen with a vast domain
who's subjects seem to thrive on everything that swings
i could tell you more but my plane's about to leave for dallas
i could tell you more but I got to catch that plane for dallas
there's a whole lot more but I got to catch a plane to dallas
slow down slow down old world
there's no hurry cause
my life ain't mine anymore
[verse 1]
i lived too fast
now it's too late to worry
and I'm too blue to cry anymore
i once was a fool for the women
now I'm just a fool nothing more
slow down slow down old world
there's no hurry cause
my life ain't mine anymore
[verse 2]
i once had a way with the women
till one got away with my heart
slow down slow down old world
there's no hurry cause
my life ain't mine anymore
[verse 1]
pay no mind to her she only wants to play
she's not for you she's not for you
and I'm the only one who would let her act this way
and she's not for you she's not for you
[verse 2]
so she told you she found heaven in your eyes
well I think it only fair to warn you sometimes she lies
but it's your heart I can't tell you what to do
but she's not for you not for you she's not for you no
[verse 3]
she just looks for greener pastures now and then
and when she grows tired she knows old faithful will just take her back again
so just leave her here I'm used to feeling blue
she's not for you she's not for you
she was cuter than a speckled pup just turned 21
she had a lot of fun playing with my gun
just before the sun come up she couldn't take no more
she came undone crying crawling for the door
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
and the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
and it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
white lightning is the horse I ride pedal to the floor
he blows hot from his nostrils and runs like man-o-war
someday we both may wind up in some junkyard on the side
until that day you bet your ass we're gonna win that ride
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
and the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
and it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
some super stars nowdays get too far off the ground
singing 'bout the backroads they never have been down
they go and call it country but that ain't the way it sounds
it's enough to make a renegade want to terrorize the town
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
and the only friends that's left is them behind them swinging doors
and it's hard to keep your trying when your back is to the floor
and it's hard to be an outlaw who ain't wanted anymore
[verse 1]
they're working while I'm missing you those healing hands of time
and soon they'll be dismissing you from this heart of mine
they'll lead me safely through the night and I'll follow as though blind
my future tightly clutched within those healing hands of time
[verse 2]
they let me close my eyes just then those healing hands of time
and soon they'll let me sleep again those healing hands of time
so already I've reached mountain peaks and I've just begun to climb
i'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
i'll get over you by clinging to those healing hands of time
i bless the day I found you
i want to stay around you
and so I beg you let it be me
don't take this heaven from one
if you must cling to someone
now and forever let it be me
each time we meet love
i find complete love
and without your sweet love
what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll always let it be me
[guitar solo]
each time we meet love
i find complete love
and without your sweet love
what would life be
so never leave me lonely
tell me you love me only
and that you'll always let it be me
i'm confessing that I love you
tell me do you love me too
i'm confessing that I need you
honest I do need you every moment
in your eyes I read such strange things
but your lips deny they're true
will your answer really change things
making me blue
i'm afraid someday you'll leave me
saying can't we still be friends
if you go you know you'll grieve me
all in life on you depends
am I guessing that you love me
dreaming dreams of you in vain
i'm confessing that I love you
over again
i'm afraid someday you'll leave me
saying can't we still be friends
if you go you know you'll grieve me
all in life on you depends
am I guessing that you love me
dreaming dreams of you in vain
i'm confessing that I love you
over again
now I've heard there was a secret chord
that david played and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music do you
it goes like this
the fourth the fifth
the minor fall the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
she tied you
to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
you say I took the name in vain
i don't even know the name
but if I did well really what's it to you
there's a blaze of light
in every word
it doesn't matter which you heard
the holy or the broken hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
i did my best it wasn't much
i couldn't feel so I tried to touch
i've told the truth I didn't come to fool you
and even though it all went wrong
i'll stand before the lord of song
with nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
hallelujah hallelujah
we don't run we don't compromise
we don't quit we never do
we look for love we find it in the eyes
the eyes of me and the eyes of you
[verse 1]
you are the road you are the only way
i'll follow you forever more
we'll look for love we'll find it in the eyes
the eyes that see through all the doors
there is a train that races through the night
on rails of steel that reach the soul
fueled by fire as soft as candle light
but it warms the heart of a love grown cold
[verse 2]
words that feel words that sympathize
words that heal and understand
say them now let them materialize
say the words throughout the land
[verse 1]
i'll take you with me everywhere I go
i'll put you in my pocket who will know
right next to my heart at every show
i'll take you with me everywhere I go
[instrumental break]
no matter where our trails will finally wind
our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
until then and in my pocket you must go
i'll take you with me everywhere I go
[instrumental break]
no matter where our trails will finally wind
our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
until then and in my pocket you must go
and I'll take you with me everywhere I go
until then and in my pocket you must go
and I'll take you with me everywhere I go
[verse 1]
soft as the voice of an angel breathing a lesson unheard
hope with a gentle persuasion whispers her comforting word
"wait till the darkness is over wait till the tempest is done
hope for the sunshine tomorrow after the shower is gone"
whispering hope oh how welcome thy voice
making my heart in its sorrow rejoice
[verse 2]
if in the dusk of the twilight dim be the region afar
will not the deepening darkness brighten the glimmering star
then when the night is upon us why should the heart sink away
when the dark midnight is over watch for the breaking of day
[verse 3]
hope as an anchor so steadfast rends the dark veil for the soul
whither the master has entered robbing the grave of its goal
come then o come glad fruition come to my sad weary heart
come o thou blest hope of glory never o never depart
[verse 1]
when you're weary feeling small
when tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
i'm on your side
when times get rough
and friends just can't be found
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
when you're down and out
when you're on the street
when evening falls so hard
i will comfort you
i'll take your part
when darkness comes
and pain is all around
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
[verse 2]
sail on silver girl
sail on by
your time has come to shine
all your dreams are on their way
see how they shine
if you need a friend
i'm sailing right behind
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
like a bridge over troubled water
i will lay me down
[verse 1]
well I once knew a pirate named bob
b-o-b bob was a drunken old slob
b-o-b bob 'bout as dumb as a rock
but bob
he made it to the top
he said you swing from your tree
and I'll swing from mine
you have your lemons and I'll have my lime
funny we all act like monkeys sometimes
so you swing from your tree and I'll swing from mine
i'll swing from mine
[verse 2]
he said I'd rather make love than war
and I'd rather have millions than to ever be poor
but I'd rather be happy than to have anymore
guess I'm a lil tangled in the vine
oh you swing from your tree
and I'll swing from mine
you have your lemons and I'll have my lime
funny we all act like monkeys sometimes
so you swing from your tree and I'll swing from mine
i'll swing from mine
we'll all be happy sometimes
and we'll all be happy sometimes
[verse 1]
i hope I won't disturb you with this call
i'm just in town for such a little while
and I thought perhaps you'd like to hear the news
jeannie's grades were the highest in the school
billy sure does look a lot like you
i understand your other son does too
and billy said tell mom I miss her so
these were some little things I thought you'd like to know
[verse 2]
remember sam and peg who lived next door
with them it seemed we always laughed so much
well sam and peg don't live there anymore
i understand they broke up just like us
the house we lived in now has been torn down
of all the things we owned the last to go
a freeway now runs through that part of town
these were some little things that I thought you'd like to know
these were some little things that I thought you'd like to know
[verse 1]
today as I walk through my garden of dreams
i'm alone in the sweet used-to-be
my past and my present are one and the same
and the future holds nothing for me
yesterday's kisses still burning
and yesterday's mem'ries still find me
scenes from the past keep returning
i've got a wonderful future behind me
[verse 2]
you say there is happiness waiting for me
but I know this is just fantasy
let me trade one tomorrows for one yesterday
live in my garden of dreams
yesterday's kisses still burning
and yesterday's mem'ries still find me
scenes from the past keep returning
i've got a wonderful future behind me
the falling leaves drift by my window
the autumn leaves of red and gold
i see your lips the summer kisses
the sun-burned hands I used to hold
since you went away the days grow long
and soon I'll hear old winter's song
but I miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall
since you went away the days grow long
and soon I'll hear old winter's song
but I miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall
but I miss you most of all my darling
when autumn leaves start to fall
[verse 1]
this could be our last good night together
we may never pass this way again
just let me enjoy it till it's over or forever
please don't tell me how the story ends
[verse 2]
see the way our shadows come together
softer than your fingers on my skin
someday these may be all we remember of each other
please don't tell me how the story ends
[verse 3]
never's just the echo of forever
lonesome as the love that might have been
let me go on loving and believing till it's over
please don't tell me how the story ends
please don't tell me how the story ends
[verse 1 willie nelson]
why do I still write
why do I still call
why do I still think
there's hope for us at all
these are the things I hate
but they're the things I do
to get over you
[verse 2 bonnie raitt]
sunsets make me cry
old pictures make me grin
but I don't really care
to see your face again
these are the things I say
but they're so hard to do
like gettin' over you
[pre-chorus willie nelson & bonnie raitt]
you gotta believe that there's a reason
that we surrender up our hearts
but there's a vantage point
and it takes some time to find
where you can see how all the pieces fit
as you watch 'em fall apart
[chorus willie nelson & bonnie raitt both]
now I don't think it's right
and you don't know what's wrong
my heart keeps asking me
just where do we belong
it's not as though my life
ain't hard enough to do
try gettin' over you
[pre-chorus willie nelson & bonnie raitt]
you gotta believe that there's a reason
that we surrender up our hearts
but there's a vantage point
and it takes some time to find
where you can see how all the pieces fit
as you watch 'em fall apart
[chorus 2 willie nelson & bonnie raitt both]
and other people say
stop living in the past
but when there's nothing left
it's your memory that lasts
it's later than you think
but still this isn't through
this gettin' over you
now it's later than you think
and still this isn't through
this gettin' over you
don't look so sad I know it's over
but life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
there's no need to watch the bridges that were burning
lay your head upon my pillow hold your warm and tender body close to mine
hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft against the window
and make believe you love me one more time for the good times
i'll get along you'll find another
i'll be here if you should find you ever need me
don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
there'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me
lay your head upon my pillow[]
[verse 1]
on a rainy wednesday morning that's the way that I was born in
that old sharecropper's one room country shack
they said my mommy left me the day before she had me
said she hit the road and never once looked back
and I just like to mention my grandma's old age pension
is the reason why I'm standing here today
i got all my country learning milking and churning
picking cotton raising hell and baling hay
i've been to georgia on a fast train honey
i wasn't born no yesterday
i got a good christian raisin' and an eight grade education
there's no need in you all treating me this way
[verse 2]
oh muy sweet carolina I don't think I'll ever find
another woman put together like you are
i like your wiggle in your walking and your big city talking
and your brand new shiny plymouth rag top car
well let's hurry up and wait in this land of give and take
it seems like haste it makes for waste every time
i declare to my soul when you hear those ages roll
you better know I'm going to get my share of mine
i've been to georgia on a fast train honey
i wasn't born no yesterday
i got a good christian raisin' and an eight grade education
there's no need in you all treating me this way
i've been to georgia on a fast train honey
i wasn't born no yesterday
i got a good christian raisin' and an eight grade education
there's no need in you all treating me this way
i've been to georgia on a fast train
i've been to georgia on a fast train
there is no need in you all treating me this way
three days that I dread to see arrive
three days that I hate to be alive
three days filled with tears and sorrow
yesterday today and tomorrow
there are three days I know that I'll be blue
three days that I'll always dream of you
and it does no good to wish these days would end
'cause the same three days start over again
three days that I dread be alive
three days that I hate to see arrive
three days filled with tears and sorrow
yesterday today and tomorrow
there are three days I know that I'll be blue
three days that I'll always dream of you
and it does no good to wish these days would end
'cause the same three days start over again
three days that I dread to see arrive
three days that I hate to be alive
three days filled with tears and sorrow
yesterday today and tomorrow
three days
three days
[verse 1]
today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd be
i had to know if you still had the same effect on me
and the moment that I saw you there I knew
no matter what I do I'm still not over you
i'm still not over you that feeling's still the same
and I'm still not over you I find that nothing's changed
and perhaps some day I'll find somebody new
but now it's much too soon I'm still not over you
no matter what I do I'm still not over you
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
i can't explain why seeing you affects my sanity
but when I see you I become estrange and differently
and the moment that I saw you there I knew
no matter what I do I'm still not over you
i'm still not over you I find that nothing's changed
i'm still not over you that feeling's still the same
and perhaps some day I'll find somebody new
but now it's much too soon I'm still not over you
no matter what I do I'm still not over you
[verse 1]
when the world is crashing down
and you're left alone on shaky ground
it seems like losing hope's
the only way to cope
you can turn around and see
that every precious memory
is still inside of you
just let it shine on through
don't fade away
nothing's what it seems
you're lost and in between
but you'll find yourself again
don't fade away don't fade away
[verse 2]
take your time and think it through
you've got everything in front of you
it's like a brand new page
each and every day
[chorus 1]
don't fade away
nothing's what it seems
you're lost and in between
but you'll find yourself again
[chorus 2]
don't fade away
hold on to your dreams
through waves of suffering
the tide will turn again
don't fade away
all that you've seen
all that you've done
don't day it's over
you hold the key
unlock the sun
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
don't fade away don't fade away [x3]
don't fade away
when the world is crashing down
don't fade away
and you're left alone on shaky ground
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
don't fade away
i'm a rollin' stone all alone and lost
for a life of sin I have paid the cost
when I pass by all the people say
just another guy on the lost highway
just a deck of cards and a jug of wine
and a woman's lies makes a life like mine
oh the day we met I went astray
started rolling down that lost highway
i was just a lad nearly twenty-two
neither good nor bad just a kid like you
and now I'm lost too late to pray
lord I take a cost on the lost highway
now boys don't start to ramblin' round
on this road of sin are you sorrow bound
take my advice or you'll curse the day
you started rollin' down that lost highway
i don't feel anything what was I worried for
i don't feel love or hate or anything that I felt before
why was I so afraid of seeing you again
because it's the strangest thing I don't feel anything
[verse 1]
how I must have loved you once upon a time
and I can't seem to feel emotion now of any kind
[verse 2]
you look the same as always time's been good to you
but I must confess that time has done a few things for me too
[verse 1]
the hill country
the hill country of texas
the hill country
the country that I love
where wild wings fly
above the peaceful valleys
and the pedernales
flows lazily beneath the texas skies
[verse 2]
the hill country
the hill country of texas
it knew my folks my family
and my friends
[verse 3]
the boy who rode his pony in the sunlight
the man who prayed at midnight
and gave him strength
to carry on again
and when the night falls
and when my god calls
where wild wings fly
above the peaceful valleys
by the pedernales
please let me sleep beneath the texas skies
and when the night falls
and when my god calls
where wild wings fly
above the peaceful valleys
by the pedernales
please let me sleep beneath the texas skies
see him wasted on the sidewalk in his jacket and his jeans
wearing yesterday's misfortunes like a smile
once he had a future full of money love and dreams
which he spent like they was going out of style
and he keeps right on a changing for the better or the worse
and searching for a shrine he's never found
never knowing if believing is a blessing or a curse
or if the going up is worth to coming down
he's a poet he's a picker he's a prophet he's a pusher
he's a pilgrim and a preacher and a problem when he's stoned
he's a walking contradiction partly truth and partly fiction
taking every wrong direction on his lonely way back home
he has tasted good and evil in your bedrooms and your bars
and he's traded in tomorrow for today
running from the devils lord and reaching for the stars
and losing all he loved along the way
but if this world keeps right on turning for the better or the worse
and all he ever gets is older and around
from the rocking of the cradle to the rolling of the hearse
the going up was worth the coming down
he's a poet he's a picker[]
[verse 1]
once I knowed a guitar picker lived his life on wine and liquor
running around in one of them new machines
he was about the proudest feeling wheeling dealing
sneaking stealing aggravating man I've ever seen
nothing but a midnight rambler biggest drunkard and a gambler
he'd do anything that wasn't nice
hunting golfing fishing swimming running around with other women
playing dominoes and shooting dice
[verse 2]
then one night as he was dining while the moon was brightly shining
with his secret love he was so gay
he would laugh and call her 'honey' while she proudly spent his money
as they hugged and smooched the time away
laughing joking dining dancing
planning parties and romancing having fun regardless of the price
eating caviar and chicken strumming his guitar and picking
playing dominoes and shooting dice
[verse 3]
then his wife walked in and found him with that pretty girl around him
started making headway for the gate
when he seen those girls dividing he commenced to slip and sliding
but he seemed to know it was too late
crowds began to getting thinner they jumped up and left their dinner
no one seemed to have an appetite
not a person dare defend her everyone jumped out the window
no one hung around to see the fight
then she grabbed him by the collar he commenced to squeal and holler
as she plastered him betwixt the eyes
and then his old guitar she swung it over his head she proudly hung it
bruises knots and bumps began to rise
he leapt up and tried to squeeze her but she warped across the beezer
pulled a pistol and shot him once or twice
when the wicked fight was over he was laid beneath the clover
playing dominoes and shooting dice
are there any more real cowboys
left out in these hills
will the fire hit the iron one more time
and will one more dusty pick-up
come rolling down the road
with a load of feed before the sun gets high
well I hope that working cowboy never dies
not the one that's snortin' cocaine
when the honky-tonk's all closed
but the one that prays for more rain heaven knows
that the good feed brings the money
and the money buys the clothes
not the diamond sequins shining on tv
but the kind the working cowboy really needs
are there any more country families
still working hand in hand
trying hard to stay together and make a stand
while the rows and rows of houses
come creepin' up on the land
where the cattle graze and an old gray barn still stands
are there any more real cowboys in this land
are there any more real cowboys in this land
[verse 1]
as I walked out in the streets of laredo
as I walked out in laredo one day
i spied a young cowboy wrapped all in white linen
wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay
oh beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly
sing the death march as you carry me along
take me to the green valley there lay the sod o'er me
i'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
[verse 2]
i see by your outfit that you are a cowboy
these words he did say as I boldly walked by
come sit down beside me and hear my sad story
got shot in the breast and know I must die
beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly
sing the death march as you carry me along
take me to the green valleys there lay the sod o'er me
i'm a young cowboy and I know I've done wrong
[verse 3]
go fetch me some water a cool drink of water
to cool my parched lips the poor cowboy said
before I returned his spirit had left him
he had gone to his maker the cowboy was dead
beat the drum slowly play the fife lowly
sing the death march as you carry me along
take me to the green valleys and lay the sod o'er me
i'm a young cowboy and I known I've done wrong
i'm a young cowboy and I known I've done wrong
[verse 1]
today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday
one on which I know that I can look back and smile
and with you here with me the hours have flown away
and today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday
[verse 2]
today we have made a thousand and one memories
that we can recall when today is a sweet used to be
and with you in my arms the future seems so far away
and today's gonna make a wonderful yesterday
[verse 1]
life is a picture and I play the lead
but my biggest line was goodbye
now my leading lady has walked out on me
and this is the part where I cried
i was great in the scene where she found someone new
you should have seen my look of surprise
and if you have just walked into the picture
this is the part where I cry
[verse 2]
and after the picture is over
and it's judged for the part where she lied
the award of achievement that's given
will be mine for the part where I cried
i was great in the scene where she found someone new
you should have seen my look of surprise
and if you have just walked into the picture
this is the part where I cry
[verse 1]
did I ever ever love you
did I ever really care
all the times that I cried for you
did I really want you there
wiser men than I have wondered
about love and never knew
and if I ever loved you
i guess I still do
[verse 2]
all the nights that I spent crying
all those lonely lonesome times
was it my imagination
was it only in my mind
wiser men than I have wondered
about love and never knew
and if I ever loved you
i guess I still do
[verse 3]
is it here today and gone tomorrow
this love that no one can explain
can it begin a thing of beauty
then undergo a dreadful change
wiser men than I have wondered
about love and never knew
and if I ever loved you
i guess I still do
good ol' boys
just'a good ol' boys
never meanin' no harm
beats all you never saw
been in trouble with the law
since the day they was born
staightnin' the curves
flatnin the hills
someday the mountain might get 'em
but the law never will
makin' their way
the only way they know how
that's just a little bit more
than the law will allow
makin' their way
the only way they know how
that's just a little bit more
than the law will allow
i'm a good ol' boy
you know my momma loves me
but she don't undestand
they keep a showin my hands and not my face on tv
why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
to walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse
[verse 1]
love is hard to find love of any kind
and a love like yours and mine creates it's own design
why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
to walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse
[verse 2]
and when I think of her and then I think of you
the love is not the same but either love is true
why do I have to choose to see everybody lose
to walk around and sing the blues well darling I refuse
explain again to me lord when I'm here
i don't know I don't know
the setting for the stage is still not clear
where's the show where's the show
let it begin let it begin I'm born can you use me
what would you have me to do lord
shall I sing them a song
i could tell them all about you lord
i could write of the loves I have known
i'll work in their cotton and cornfields
i promise to do all I can
i'll laugh and I'll cry
i'll live and I'll die
please lord let me be a man
dear lord let me be a man
and I'll give it all that I can
if I'm needed in this distant land
please lord let me be a man
before I begin this level of journeying
portraying most typical man
last minute instructions
would surely be welcome
please lord let me hold to your hand
dear lord let me be a man
and I'll give it all that I can
if I'm needed in this distant land
please lord let me be a man
blue spanish eyes
teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes
please please don't cry
this is just adios and not goodbye
soon I'll return
bringing you all the love your heart can hold
please say si si

[foreign content]

[verse 1]
the morning that you left me was just another day
how could I see the sorrow that had found me
then you left and told me that I was in your way
and I turned and ran as heaven fell around me
[verse 2]
i stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure
i live within a world that had no sunshine
when you left me darling my world came to an end
and there was darkness on the face of the earth
the stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found
the sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
why did you ever leave me you knew how it would hurt
and now there's darkness on the face of the earth
[instrumental break]
the stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found

well I love my wives and my girlfriends
may they never meet
may they never know each other
when they pass on the street
well I might be a mormon or I might be a heathen or a gambler I just don't know
but I love my wives and my girlfriends
turn 'em all out and let 'em all go
[verse 1]
wife number nine she sure was fine so was number seven
oh number six still makes me sick so does number eleven
sweet jolene from new orleans showed up there with number five
i got caught with my britches down
and I barely make it out alive
[verse 2]
wife number one was a whole lotta fun and number two had
her own deal
wife number three blew out number four
and it was even more unreal
sweet ann-mary from tucson county
had me thinkin' about settlin' down
betty lou and her sister sue came calling
when I hit their town
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
[verse 1]
cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to hold
and they'd rather give you a song than diamonds and gold
lonestar belt buckles and old faded levis
and each night begins a new day
and if you don't understand him and he don't die young
he'll probably just ride away
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
[verse 2]
cowboys like smoky old pool rooms and clear mountain mornings
little warm puppies and children and girls of the night
and them that don't know him won't like him
and them that do sometimes won't know how to take him
he ain't wrong he's just different but his pride won't let him
do things to make you think he's right
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
they'll never stay home and they're always alone
even with someone they love
mama don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys
don't let 'em pick guitars or drive them old trucks
make 'em be doctors and lawyers and such
mama don't let your babies grow up
[verse 1]
been feeling kind of free
but I sure do feel lonesome
baby's taking a trip
but she isn't taking me
i've been feeling kind of free
but I'd rather feel your arms around me
because you're taking away
everything that I wanted
there's an old hollow tree
where we carved our initials
and I said I love you
and you said you love me
it's a memory today
it'll be a memory tomorrow
i hope you'll be happy someday
and your memory won't die in my grave
[verse 1]
now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel
and the storm's brewing in this heart of mine
this ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real
and you're someone else's love now you're not mine
crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new
and my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine
my troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed
and that's why I'm lonely all the time
[verse 2]
so please take these treasured dreams I have for you and me
and take all the love I thought was mine
someday these crazy arms will hold somebody new but now I'm so lonely all the time
crazy arms that reach to[]
and that's why I'm lonely all the time
you say eether and I say eyether
you say neether and I say nyther

i live one day at a time
i dream one dream at a time
yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
and I live one day at a time
[verse 1]
guess that's your surprise to see me back at home
but you know how much I miss you when I'm gone
don't ask how long I planned to stay it never it crossed my mind
i live one day at a time
[verse 2]
see that sparrow fly across the cloudy sky
searching for a patch of sunlight so am i

i live one day at a time

yesterday's dead and tomorrow is blind
and I live one day at a time
i live one day at a time
those far away places with strange sound and names
far away over sea
far away places with the strange sound and names
are calling calling me
i go into china or maybe siam I wanna see for myself
those far away places I've been reading bout
in a book that I took from a shelf
i keep wishing I was somewhere else way on a train
i pray for the day I can get under way
and search for those castles in spain
they call me a dreamer well maybe I am
but I know that I'm burning to see
those far away places with strange sound and names
far away over sea
far away places with the strange sound and names
are calling calling me
[verse 1]
he was tougher than leather
and he didn't care whether
the sun shined or not
when a young kid from cow town
wanted a showdown
and he was careless or just maybe forgot
[verse 2]
but he died in the gunfight
blinded by sunlight
never draw when you're facing the sun
and old tougher than leather
just carved one more notch on his gun
[verse 3]
and when he turned to go
a beautiful maiden knelt down
where her dead sweetheart lay
and on his breast placed a rose
while the townspeople stared in dismay
[verse 4]
and old tougher than leather
should have known better
but he picked up the rose in his hand
and the townspeople froze
when his hands crushed the rose
and the rose petals fell in the sand
[verse 5]
and old tougher than leather
was a full-time go-getter
the grass never grew beneath his feet
from one town to another
he would ride like the wind
but his mind kept going back to the street
[verse 6]
where a young cowboy died
and a young maiden cried
and rose petals fell in the sand
and his heart had been softened
by the beautiful maid
and he knew he must see her again
[verse 7]
well he went back to the town
where it all had come down
and he searched but his search was in vain
he had wanted to find her
and say he was sorry
for causing her heart so much pain
[verse 8]
but one night he died
from a poison inside
brought on by the wrong he had done
and old tougher than leather
had carved his last notch on his gun
[verse 9]
well he was buried in cow town
along about sundown
looking good in his new store-bought clothes
when the young maiden came over
and knelt down beside him
and on his lapel placed a rose
there's a bird in the sky
flying high flying high
to a place from a place
changing skies changing skies
you're wondering just what I'll do
now that it's over and done
well that's something to think about
and I've already begun
i suppose that I'll find a way people usually do
but it's something to think about I'll be lost without you
one thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
the dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
and when you can no longer have any sweetheart you choose
here is something to think about
i'll still be thinking of you
one thing I would have you do please consider the dawn
the dawn of your lonely years when youth and beauty are gone
and when you can no longer have any sweetheart you choose
here is something to think about
i'll still be thinking of you
[verse 1]
it might be in the middle of the afternoon
maybe somewhere in the middle of the night
i might not be thinking anything at all
when a perfect stranger's face catches a certain light
and my heart jumps 'cause all at once
there you are standing right in front of me
there you are as lovely as you'll always be
and here I go back into those memories
where you are still in love with me
[verse 2]
i know I'll never hold you in my arms again
i know I'll never hear you speak my name
i look around this lonely room and I can see
your memory's the only thing that hasn't changed
and I close my eyes and every time
there you are standing right in front of me
there you are as lovely as you'll always be
and here I go back into those memories
where you are still in love with me
there you are still in love with me
these are difficult times
these are difficult times
lord please give me a sign
for these are difficult times
remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
don't waste a moment unhappy
invaluable moments gone with the leakage of time
as we leave on our own separate journeys
moving west with the sun to a place buried deep within our minds
and remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
from somewhere behind you
you've come with your suitcase in hand
hey what's your plan
where do you stand
[verse 1]
the world's still divided
and you're still undecided decide if you can
hey what's your plan
where do you stand
where do you stand
where do you stand
hey what's your plan
where do you stand
[verse 2]
it's time for commitments
it's time for a showing of hands
hey what's your plan
where do you stand
surely there's someone with courage
to say where he stands
hey what's your plan
where do you stand
where do you stand
where do you stand
lord lord lord lord
lord lord lord
[verse 1 willie nelson]
it ain't nobody's business if I do
some of these days I'm going crazy
buy me a shotgun shoot my baby
it ain't nobody's business if I do
[verse 2 jonny lang]
if I should take a notion
to go right down and jump in the ocean
it ain't nobody's business if I do
[verse 3]
one day I have chicken and dumplins
the next day I don't have nothing
it ain't nobody's business if I do
and if I attended church on sunday
and cabaret all day monday
well it ain't nobody's business if I do
and if I stay out all night
and spend my money well that's alright
it ain't nobody's business if I do
lord lord lord lord
it ain't nobody's business if I do
[verse 1]
and now the end is near
and so I face the final curtain
my friend I'll say it clear
i'll state my case of which I'm certain
i've lived a life that's full
i traveled each and every highway
and more much more than this I did it my way
[verse 2]
regrets I've had a few
but then again too few to mention
i did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption
i planned each charted course each careful step along the byway
and more much more than this I did it my way
[verse 3]
yes there were times I'm sure you knew
when I bit off more than I could chew
but through it all when there was doubt
i ate it up and spit it out
i faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way
[verse 4]
i've loved I've laughed and cried
i've had my fill my share of losing
and now as tears subside I find it all so amusing
to think I did all that
and may I say not in a shy way
oh no oh no not me I did it my way
[verse 5]
for what is a man what has he got
if not himself then he has naught
to say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels
the record shows I took the blows and did it my way
i did it my way
[verse 1]
yesterday as I talked with a friend in town
i forgot to remember that you'd gone
and for a moment I found myself smiling
but a moment isn't very long
[verse 2]
and last night as I danced with a stranger
and she held her cheek close to my own
for a moment I almost forgot you
but a moment isn't very long
every now and then I get a chance to smile
but those every now and then's just last a little while
[verse 3]
and tonight I've got a date with a new love
but I know I'd do just as well at home
for a moment maybe I could forget you
but a moment isn't very long
but a moment isn't very long
[verse 1]
my oatmeal tastes just like confetti
the coffee's too strong so forget it
the toast is burning well let it
there's just so much to do since you've gone
too much to do all alone
[verse 2]
my tie's lost I can't find my sweater
there's the doorbell I hope that's your letter
my head aches I hope I feel better
there's just so much to do since you've gone
too much to do all alone
so much to do since you've gone
too much to do all alone
and time time rolls on like a river
and oh there's just so much to do
and I just can't do without you
too many pain pills too much pot
tryin to be something that I'm not
superman superman
tryin to do more than I can
i ain't superman
well I blew my throat and I blew my tour
i wound up sippin on soup d'jour
i wasn't superman I wasn't superman
try to do more than I can
i wasn't superman
well the doctor said son it's a cryin shame
but you ain't clark kent and I ain't lois lane
you ain't superman you ain't superman
tryin to do more than you can

and when I die put it on my stone
god said sucker get your bad ass home
you wasn't superman you ain't superman
tryin to do more than you can
you ain't superman
tryin to do more than than you can
but you ain't superman
[verse 1]
you told me you'd love me forever
but the one in your arms is not me
so if this is what you refer to as love
then I'd rather you didn't love me
i have waited so long for your love now
but I've made up my mind it can't be
for if I am just one of the many you love
then I'd rather you didn't love me
[verse 2]
how can I name the one to blame
i suppose it's the way you believe
but if this is what you refer to as love
then I'd rather you didn't love me
and if I am just one of the many you love
then I'd rather you didn't love me
i'd rather you didn't love me
[verse 1]
mr record man I'm looking for a song I heard today
there was someone blue singing not someone who went away
just like me his heart was yearning for a love that used to be
it's a lonely song about a lonely man like me
there was something 'bout a love that didn't treat him right
and he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
mr record man get this record for me won't you please
it's a lonely song about a lonely man like me
[verse 2]
i was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
and the man that I heard singing sound so blue and all alone
as I listened to his lonely song I wondered could it be
could there somewhere be another lonely man like me
there was something 'bout a love that didn't treat him right
and he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
mr record man get this record for me won't you please
it's a lonely song about a lonely man like me
[verse 1]
the mississippi delta was shining like a national guitar
i am following the river down the highway through the cradle of the civil war
i'm going to graceland graceland in memphis tennessee I'm going to graceland
poor boys and pilgrims with families and we are going to graceland
my traveling companion is nine years old the child of my first marriage
but I've reason to believe we both will be received in graceland
she comes back to tell me she's gone
[verse 2]
as if I didn't know that as if I didn't know my own bed
as if I'd never noticed she way she brushed her hair from her forehead
and she said losing love is like a window in your heart
everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow
i'm going to graceland graceland in memphis tennessee I'm going to graceland
poor boys and pilgrims with families and we are going to graceland
my traveling companions are ghosts and empty sockets ghosts and empties
but I've reason to believe we both will be received in graceland
[verse 3]
there is a girl in austin texas and she calls herself the human trampoline
sometimes when I'm falling flying tumbling in turmoil I say this is what she means
she means we're bouncing into graceland
and I see losing love is like a window in your heart
everybody sees you're blown apart everybody feels the wind blow
and I'm going to graceland in memphis tennessee I'm going to graceland
for reasons I cannot explain some part of me wants to see graceland
and I may be obliged to defend every love every ending
or maybe there's no obligations now
maybe I've a reason to believe we all will be received in graceland
oh oh graceland I'm going to graceland
hear that lonesome whippoorwill
he sounds too blue to fly
that means he's lost the will to live
i'm so lonesome I could cry
did you ever see a night so slow
as time goes dragging by
the moon just went behind the clouds
to hide its face and cry
the silence of a falling star
lights up a purple sky
and as I wonder where you are
i'm so lonesome I could cry
i'm so lonesome I could cry
i'm so lonesome I could cry
front porch sitting in an old rocking chair
the sun is hot in the texas sky
garden growing clothes out on the line
dusty road when a car goes by
story telling of days long ago
and the only place she'd ever been
singing softly this world is not my home
memories take me back again
when I was young and grandma wasn't old
when she guided me as I watched life unfold
anything we didn't have we didn't really need to hold
when I was young and grandma wasn't old
[verse 2]
she'd throw a party and all of her friends
would gather around the quilting frames
they'd always call out for me to come inside
and give me nickels and dimes to sing
it makes me happy that I can still go back
my memories are so clear
of how it used to be when I never dreamed
of ever looking back from here
when I was young and grandma wasn't old
[verse 1]
i've got a new car and it drives just like a dream
i've got money and can buy most anything
i've got places to go an' things to do
i've got everything everything but you
[verse 2]
i've got a date book that's just bulging at the seams
i've got the numbers of all the local queens
they give me memories that last a day or two
i've got everything everything but you
but this new car I drive don't mean anything
which reminds me there's a payment overdue
an' they say that I'm a man who's got everything
yeah I've got everything everything but you
and this new car that I drive don't mean anything
which reminds me there's a payment overdue
and they say that I'm a man who's got everything
yeah I've got everything everything but you
[verse 1]
some people go to school trying to learn how to teach
some people go to school trying to learn how to preach
but if you can't preach without going school
brother you're no preacher you're an educated fool
and that's all that's all that's all and that's all
you'd better change your way of living because the good lord say that's all
[verse 2]
now a feller I know it's a miser man trying to save all the money that he can
but when the undertaker lets him down
where's he going to spend that money under the ground
and that's all and that's all
you'd better change your way of living because the good lord say that's all
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
now a man come from monkey some people say
but the good book brother just don't tell it that way
and if you believe that monkey tale like some folks do
then I'd rather be that monkey than you
and that's all that's all that's all and that's all
you'd better change your way of living because the good lord say that's all
[verse 4]
well my little song is ended and my little song is through
and I didn't necessarily mean this song for you
but if you don't like the way the little song goes
well it's a mighty good sign that I've been tromping on your toes
and that's all and that's all
you'd better change your way of living because the good lord say that's all
now that's all
[verse 1]
up in the morning out on my job work like a devil for my pay
[chorus 1]
and that lucky old sun ain't got nothing to do but roll around heaven all day
[verse 2]
fuss with my woman toil with my kids sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
[chorus 1]
[verse 3]
lord above can't you see I'm crying tears are in my eyes
sending down my cloud with that silvery lining take me to paradise
show me that river lead me across take all my troubles away
[chorus 1]
[chorus 1]
till the stars in the sky cease to shine
till the sand in the desert grows cold
till the last petals fall from the roses
and the silver in your hair turns back to gold
[chorus 2]
till the sun and the moon hide in darkness
and we wait for that great light to shine
oh my darling that's how long I will love you
till the end of the world you'll be mine
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
oh my darling that's how long I will love you
till the end of the world you'll be mine
[verse 1]
there's something on your mind why don't you tell me
you act as though your heart is miles away
i speak to you but you don't even hear me
don't be unkind is there something on your mind
[verse 2]
you look at me with eyes that never see me
you're watching memories down in your heart
is there someone from the past you can't forget dear
don't be unkind is there something on your mind
[verse 3]
even though you tried your best to love me
i know I can't compete with memories
so tell me now before the vows are spoken
while there's still time is there something on your mind
[verse 1]
well the moon is broken
and the sky is cracked

so come on up to the house
[verse 2]

no irons in the fire

and your singing lead soprano
in a junk-man's choir
you gotta come on up to the house
does life seem nasty brutish and short
come on up to the house
the seas are stormy
and you can't find no port
just come on up to the house
[verse 3]
there ain't nothing in the world
that you can do

that are inside you
so just come on up to the house

of your mountain of woe

well you know you should surrender
but you just can't let go

your kiss so very tender
the words "will you remember me"

[verse 1]
today I passed you on the street
and my heart fell at your feet
and I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[verse 2]
somebody else stood by your side
and he looked so satisfied
and I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[verse 3]
a picture from the past came slowly stealing
as I brushed your arm and walked so close to you
and suddenly I got that old time feeling
and I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
[verse 4]
it's hard to know another's lips will kiss you
and hold you just the way I used to do
heaven only knows how much I miss you
i can't help it if I'm still in love with you
and I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
to all the girls I've loved before
who traveled in and out my door
i'm glad they came along
i dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before
to all the girls I once caressed
and may I say I've held the best
for helping me to grow
i owe a lot I know
to all the girls I've loved before
the winds of change are always blowing
and every time I try to stay
the winds of change continue blowing
and they just carry me away
to all the girls who shared my life
who now are someone else's wives
i'm glad they came along
i dedicate this song
to all the girls I've loved before
to all the girls who cared for me
who filled my nights with ecstasy
they live within my heart
i'll always be a part
of all the girls I've loved before
the winds of change are always blowing
and every time I try to stay
the winds of change continue blowing
and they just carry me away
to all the girls we've loved before
who travelled in and out our doors
we're glad they came along
we dedicate this song
to all the girls we've loved before
to all the girls we've loved before
who travelled in and out our doors
we're glad they came along
we dedicate this song
to all the girls we've loved before
this was my last mistake that's all her heart could take
now we're down to our last goodbye
her lips won't kiss me now the lips that I taught how
now we're down to our last goodbye
what can I tell her that I haven't told her
that would change her mind
'cause she's heard that line before
now all that's left for me is just the memory
of all those happy days gone by
now we're down to our last goodbye
what can I tell her that I haven't told her
that would change her mind
'cause she's heard that line before
now all that's left for me is just the memory
of all those happy days gone by
now we're down to our last goodbye
now we're down to our last goodbye
everybody's talking about me
i don't hear a word they're saying
only the echoes in my mind
everybody stops to staring
i don't even see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i'm going where the sun keeps shining
through the falling rain
going where the weather suits my clothes
banking off the northeast wind
and sailing on summer breeze
skipping over the ocean like a stone
everybody's talking about me
i don't hear a word they're saying
only the echoes of my mind
everybody stops to staring
i don't even see their faces
only the shadows of their eyes
i won't let you leave my love behind[x3]
they say there is no game without pain
well I must be gaining a lot
but I'll give it all that I've got to bring it on
well it seems that I've been here before
so if this means that there is more bring it on
it's written in the good book
that we'll never be asked
to take anymore than we can
sounds like a good plan so bring it on
if I can't see it or feel it I don't worry said someone
and I'll have to say I agree bring it on
well I know you're out there 'cause I hear you breathing
but it still don't mean nothing to me so bring it on
it's written in the good book
that we'll never be asked
to take anymore than we can
sounds like a good plan to bring it on
and it's written in good book
that we'll never be ask
to take anymore then we can
sounds like a good plan
so bring it on

it's just one more storm in the sea
so bring it on
you'll never know just how much I love you
you'll never know just how much I care
and if I tried I still couldn't hide my love for you
you ought to know for heaven I told you so
a million or more times
you went away and my heart went with you
i speak your name in my every prayer
if there is some other way to prove that I love you
i swear I don't know how
you'll never know if you don't know now
if there is some other way to prove that I love you
i swear I don't know how
you'll never know if you don't know now
you'll never know if you don't know now
i built a big pile of peanut shells on the sawdust floor
i winked at every pretty girl comin' in and out the door
yelling "hey bartender how about two more"
bottle by bottle I'm clearin' off that shelf
and I feel so good that I'm not quite myself
now they're telling me that I gotta find someplace else
well guess what
i didn't come here and I ain't leavin'
i've been thrown into better places than this
i didn't come here so I ain't leavin'
if you wanna pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss
well I spent my last dollar and drank up my last dime
now they're acting like having fun is some kind of crime
if it will make you feel better mister
i'll tell you one more time
i didn't come here and I ain't leavin'
i've been thrown into better places than this
i didn't come here and I ain't leavin'
why don't you pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss
now you can call me a taxi
you can call me a cab
i know you're gonna call me something
when I can't pay this tab
well I didn't come here so I ain't leavin'
i've been thrown into better places than this
i didn't come here and I ain't leavin'
if you wanna pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss
why don't you pucker up I got just the place for you to kiss
[verse 1]
to canaan's land I'm on my way
where the soul of man never dies
my darkest night will turn to day
where the soul of man never dies
no sad farewells dear friends there'll be no sad farewells
no tear dimmed eyes there'll be no tear-dimmed eyes
where all is love where all is peace and joy and love
and the soul never dies and the soul of man never dies
[verse 2]
the rose is blooming there for me
where the soul of man never dies
and I will spend eternity
where the soul of man never dies
[verse 3]
the love light beams across the foam
where the soul of man never dies
it shines and lights the way to home
where the soul of man never dies
[verse 4]
my life will end in deathless sleep
where the soul of man never dies
and everlasting joys I'll reap
where the soul of man never dies
[verse 5]
i'm on my way to that fair land
where the soul of man never dies
where there will be no parting hand
where the soul of man never dies
and the soul never dies
well you tell me that you care
but now you're gone you've got me crying
no use denying you done me wrong
if I could look inside your heart
maybe I would know the reason
why you are leaving me all alone
well you know it's not so
when you said you tried
well you know you lied
i didn't do one wrong thing to you
won't you tell me baby why
you went and left me here so lonely
i miss you only for I love you
did I ever make you sad
so you'd be mad enough to hurt me
and desert me for so long
well you're telling everyone what you done
you think it's funny
well listen honey you done me wrong
home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you
or any place on earth that you may be
home is where you're happy just any house will do
and I'll feel at home as long as you're with me
[verse 1]
this room could not hold me for one short minute
if you weren't here with me I'd soon be gone
that chair is just a chair when you're not in it
it takes more than rooms and chairs to make a home
home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you
or any place on earth that you may be
home is where you're happy just any house will do
and I'll feel at home as long as you're with me
[verse 2]
time someday may cause this house to crumble
but we'll move into another love and all
and if time someday should make your footsteps stumble
i'll be there to catch you should you fall
home is where you're happy and I'm happy here with you
or any place on earth that you may be
home is where you're happy just any house will do
and I'll feel at home as long as you're with me
[verse 1]
you say your heart will never break
i hope so for your sake
but happiness is sometimes hard
for hearts to cling to
you say he'll always be with you
i hope so for your sake
but should he find somebody new
what would you do
if you were wrong would you confess
i wouldn't know but I could guess
that you would act the same as i
an' cry
and should these things ever come true
when love is gone what will you do
will you accept my love for you
i hope so for my sake
if you were wrong would you confess
i wouldn't know but I could guess
that you would act the same as i
an' cry
and should these things ever come true
when love is gone what will you do
will you accept my love for you
i hope so for my sake
i could wander the byway re-wander too
but it wouldn't be the same without you
those familiar old places would just make me blue
because it wouldn't be the same without you
i wasted my love on a careless romance
but I'd do it again if I had the chance
i could start my life over with somebody new
but it wouldn't be the same without you
i wasted my love on a careless romance
but I'd do it again if I had the chance
i could start my life over with somebody new
but it wouldn't be the same without you
[verse 1]

the first time I saw her
he knew everything had changed
overnight love started blooming
like the first rose of spring
[verse 2]
auburn hair like a sunrise
sweetest smile he'd ever seen
butterflies they danced around her
like the first rose of spring
summertime would've never started
and wintertime would never end
she colored his life open his eyes
to things he'd never dream
without the first rose of spring
[verse 3]
gave him children like a garden
they gave 'em all the love they'd need
to grow up strong she made a home
and every year he'd bring
her the first rose of spring
[verse 4]
the last time he saw her
he knew everything had changed
he said goodbye
and let the tears fall like rain
on the first rose of spring
i'm waiting forever for you
for this is my destiny
this is what I am to do
[verse 1]
but forever isn't no time at all
it's only the time
between telephone calls
and the love that I hear
and your voice is so clear coming through
keeps me waiting forever
waiting forever for you
i'm waiting forever for you
for this is my destiny
this is what I am to do
[verse 2]
waiting is no waste of time
i just play out the scenes
on a stage in my mind
i love making love to your memory
it's all that I do
while I'm waiting forever
waiting forever for you
[verse 1]
she was a good looking woman no doubt
a high stepping mover that men talk about
everything bad in me she brought it out
[chorus 1]
and she was just no good for me
[verse 2]
she was wonderfully wicked and wild
with the looks of a woman
and the ways of a child
she could twist you or turn you
with a look or a smile
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
don't be taken by the look in her eyes
if she looks like an angel
it's a perfect disguise
and for somebody else she may be
[chorus 1]
[verse 3]
i'm just a fool for a looker I guess
when it comes to beauty lord knows she was blessed
i thought I could change her and I did my best
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]

said my child you are ruining your life
drinking and gambling
and staying out all night
living in a fool's paradise
living in a fool's paradise
please don't talk about me when I'm gone
oh honey though our friendship ceases from now on
if you can't say anything real nice
it's better not to talk at all is my advice
you go your way I'll go mine best that we do
here's a kiss I hope that this brings lots of luck to you
makes no difference how I carry on
please don't talk about me when I'm gone
[verse 1]
well I used to walk stooped
from the weight of my tears
i just started laying my burdens down
i used to duck bullets from the rifle of fear
i just started laying my burdens down
oh I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
oh lay I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
[verse 2]
the flesh isn't nothing but the bark on a tree
i just started laying my burdens down
the tree isn't nothing but the soul in me
i just started laying my burdens down
oh I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
oh lay I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
[verse 3]
my soul took love on a hell of a ride
i just started laying my burdens down
a soul isn't nothing but the car love drives
i just started laying my burdens down
oh I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
oh lay I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
[verse 4]
love said mama can I come on home
i just started laying my burdens down
and god said son you isn't never been gone
i just started laying my burdens down
oh I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
oh lay I'm laying them down
i just started laying my burdens down
[verse 1]
memories are haunting you and they're making you feel blue
[chorus 1]
darling a penny for your thoughts
[verse 2]
are you thinking of the past and a love that didn't last
[chorus 1]
[verse 3]
and it hurts me so to see the sorrow written on your face
and I hope and pray that some tomorrow I can take his place
but if someday we should part you can say a broken heart
[chorus 1]
[chorus 1]
i'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
and make believe it came from you
[chorus 2]
i'm going to write words oh so sweet
they're going to knock me off my feet
a lot of kisses on the bottom
i'll be glad I got them
i'm going to smile and say
i hope you're feeling better
i'll close with love the way you do
[chorus 1]
i'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
and make believe it came from you
oh yeah
[chorus 2]
i'm going to write words oh so sweet
they're going to knock me off my feet
a lot of kisses on the bottom
i'll be glad I got them
oh yeah
[chorus 1]
i'm going to sit right down and write myself a letter
and make believe it came from you
oh yeah
the face of an angel pretty eyes that shine
i lie awake at night wishing you were mine
i'm standing here holding the biggest heartache in town
whenever you come around
i get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
and I try to speak but the words won't come
i'm so scared to death
and when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
whenever you come around
i feel so helpless I feel just like a kid
what is it about you that makes me keep my feelings hid
i wish I could tell you but the words can't be found
whenever you come around
i get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
oh I try to speak but the words won't come
i'm so scared to death
and when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
whenever you come around
i get weak in the knees and I lose my breath
and I try to speak but the words won't come
i'm so scared to death
and when you smile that smile the world turns upside down
whenever you come around
and when you smile that smile
the whole world turns upside down
whenever you come around
whenever you come around
[verse 1]
it's so damn easy to say that life's so hard
everybody's got their share of battle scars
as for me I'd like to thank my lucky stars
that I'm alive and well
and it'd be easy to add up all the pain
and all the dreams you sat and watched go up in flames
you were on on the wreckage as it smolders in the rain
but not me I'm alive
and today you know that's good enough for me
breathing in and out's a blessing can't you see
today is the first day of the rest of my life
and I'm alive and well god I'm alive and well
[verse 2]
stars are dancing on the water here tonight
it's good for the soul when there's not a soul in sight
this boat has caught it's wind and brought me back to life
now I'm alive and well
amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
[verse 1]
i once was lost but now I'm found I was blind but now I see
twas grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relived
how precious did that grace appear the hours I first believed
amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
[verse 2]
now when we've been there ten thousand years bright shining as the sun
we've no less days to sing god's praise that when we first begun
amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me
if you can't say you love me say you hate me
and that you regret each time you held me tight
if you can't be mine forever then forsake me
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it was right when you loved me only
but wrong when you held another tight
so before you go away and leave me lonely
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
so please so I can face the new tomorrows
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
so please so I can face the new tomorrows
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
[verse 1]
roly poly eating corn and taters
hungry every minute of the day
roly poly gnawing on a biscuit
as long as he can chew it it's okay
he can eat an apple pie and never even bat an eye
he likes everything from a soup to hay
roly poly daddy's little fatty
i bet he's going to be a man someday
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
roly poly scrambled eggs for breakfast
bread and jelly twenty times a day
roly poly eats a hearty dinner
it takes lots of strength to run and play
well now he pulls up weeds and does the chores
runs both ways through all the doors
he works up that appetite that way
roly poly daddy's little fatty
i bet he's going to be a man someday
there goes the man who gave his heart to someone
i feel sorry for him
for that someone just gave her heart to me
[verse 1]
now he's the loser and it hurts so much to lose
an' I feel sorry for him
'cause the loser I know could have been me
oh how he loved her I'm sure he must have loved her
almost as much as me
but fate has frowned on him
then turned around and smiled on me
there goes the man who gave his heart to someone
i feel sorry for him
for that someone just gave her heart to me
[verse 2]
if things were different if he had won her heart
instead of me
i wonder if he'd find the time
to offer sympathy
there goes the man who gave his heart to someone
i feel sorry for him
for that someone just gave her heart to me
i drove in on the four lane where the two lane used to be
the highway hummed a near forgotten tune from 1963
the year I turned 18 and set my sights and heard the highway call
now the highway's come full circle to a place I scarce recall
there's a girl I still remember whose name I can't recall
i gave her what I had but then she tried to take it all
i stayed long enough to lover her and then left her on the run like a flower left to wither in that deep east texas sun
there's a place out on the highway where I go to spend my time
where the bartenders all know me and the players are friends of mine
then we light up on the breaks and talk of things that we all know
but I've heard it all before
and I'll hear it all again
and I've heard it said the highway never ends
so what about old "handsome johnny" and the class of '64
did the women all make promises when they shipped him off to war
did his momma get the medal and did his country ever win
well let's drink a round for johnny 'cause he died for all our sins
they're still down there in the factories you can see them in the mills
they've sweated there for years lord I guess they always will
and you know they won't be leavin' I can't watch them die that way
so in my rear view mirror I always watch 'em slip away
there's a place out on the highway where I go to spend my time
where the bartenders all know me and the players are friends of mine
then we light up all the breaks and talk of things that we all know
but I've heard it all before
and I'll hear it all again
and I've heard it said the highway never ends
started out with the dreams
and the plans of a wise man
and ended up with the heartaches of a fool
as a boy I would walk through the valley
gazed at the world all around
made a vow that somehow I would find fame and fortune
i found it but look at me now
i had a sweetheart who would love me forever
didn't need her I would reign all alone
and look at me I'm the king of cold lonely castle
the queen of my heart is gone
so get around me you fools for a dollar
listen to me a lesson you'll learn
well there's happiness and love sent from heaven above
and the fires of ambition will burn
started out with the dreams
and the plans of a wise man
and ended up with the heartaches of a fool
[verse 1]
i might have been a helpless soul
with nothing much in store
i might have been without a goal
just dreams and nothing more
i might have known my life alone
but that's where you came in
your loving arms have saved me from
the things I might have been
[verse 2]
i might have been the kind who roams
a stranger everywhere
just one of those poor stay-at-homes
with no one's lips to share
but your sweet kiss has changed all this
and made my life begin
so keep loving me don't let me be
the things I might have been
the things I might have been
without a song the day would never end
without a song the road would never bend
when things go wrong a man ain't got a friend
without a song
that field of corn would never see a plough
that field of corn would be deserted now
a young one's born but he's no good no how
without a song
i got my trouble and woe but sure as I know
the jordan will roll roll you river jordan
i'll get along as long as a song is strung
in my soul
i'll never know what makes the rain to fall
i'll never know what makes the grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all
without a song
i got my trouble and woe but sure as I know
the jordan will roll roll you river jordan
i'll get along as long as a song is strung
in my soul
i'll never know what makes the rain to fall
i'll never know what makes the grass so tall
i only know there ain't no love at all
without a song
all your stations are being torn down a high flying trains no longer roar
the floors're all sagging with boards at a suffering from not being used anymore
things're all changing the world's rearranging a time that will soon be no more
where has a slow movin' once quickdraw outlaw got to go
the whiskey that once settled the dust tasted so fine now taste so faint
and the mem'ries that once floated out come back stronger
and more clearly with each drink you take
and the women who warmed you once thought so pretty now look haggard and old
so where has a slow movin' once quickdraw outlaw got to go
this land where I travel once fashion with beauty now stands with scars on her face
the wide open spaces are closin' in quickly from the ways of the whole human race
and it's not that I blame them for claming her bounty
i just wish they're takin' her slow
cause where has a slow movin' once quick draw outlaw got to go
tell me where has a slow movin' once quick draw outlaw got to go
well I've been feeling a little bad
'cause I've been feeling a little better without you
it's a little like rain but it's a lot like a sunny day
and it's hard to explain but the sound of your name
don't make music anymore
it's more a sound of a love that I lost one day
[verse 1]
it's a little too late
to start thinking about starting all over
i'd rather stay where I am
i can't take another slam in the mind
i've been feeling a little bad
'cause I've been feeling a little better without you
but remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mind
[verse 2]
i've been running around
even laughing at half of the memories
you're not hard to remember
i just have to think of your name
i've been feeling a little bad
'cause I've been feeling a little better without you
but remember my love is the sound that you hear in your mind
[verse 1]
i let my mind wander
and what did it do
it just kept right on going
until it got back to you
[verse 2]
i can't trust it one minute
it's worse than a child
disobeys without conscience
and it's driving me wild
when I let my mind wander
i try to keep my mind busy
with thoughts of today
but invariably memories
seem to lure it away
my lonely heart wonders
if there'll ever come a day
when I can be happy
but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wander
i try to keep my mind busy
on thoughts of today
but invariably memories
seem to lure it away
my lonely heart wonders
if there'll ever come a day
when I can be happy
but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wander
i let my mind wander
i let my mind wander
it must have been cold there in my shadow
to never have sunlight on your face
you've been content to let me shine
you always walked a step behind
i was the one with all the glory
while you were the one with all the strength
only a face without a name
i never once heard you complain
did you ever know that you're my hero and everything I'd like to be
i can fly higher than an eagle
but you are the wind beneath my wings
it might have appeared to go unnoticed
i've got it all here in my heart
i want you to know I know the truth
i would be nothing without you I miss everything about you
did you ever know
you are the wind beneath my wings
well it's flooding down in texas
all the telephone lines are down
i said it's flooding down in texas
all the telephone lines are down
i been trying to call my baby
can't get a single sound
well the dark clouds are rolling
and I'm standing out in the rain
i said the dark clouds are rolling
and I'm standing out in the rain
muddy water keep on rolling
it's about to drive me insane
well I'm leaving you baby
and I'm going back home to stay
well I'm leaving you baby
and I'm going back home to stay
where there ain't no floods and tornados
and the sun shines every day
[verse 1]
i was born and raised on the river
it's the only life that I know
people 'round here have put a name on me
and I hear it wherever I go
they call me river boy river boy
good for nothing river boy
this old world don't hold a whole lot of joy
when you're nothing but a river boy
[verse 2]
i do a lot of fishing on the river
to make my living you see
when I take my catch to the market place
the people call out to me
and they say river boy hey river boy
you got any fish today there river boy
i sell my ware but nobody cares
about the feeling's of the river boy
[verse 3]
there's a pretty girl works at the market place
i see her there everyday
but when I try to talk to her
i can hear her papa say
come away from that river boy he's a river boy
nothing but riff-raff them river boys
no girl of mine is gonna waste her time
on a good for nothin' river boy
[verse 4]
so I head my boat back up the river
back to my old fishing place
i'm afraid this old river's gonna overflow
from the tears a-falling down my face
i'm nothing but a river boy river boy
a good for nothing river boy
this old world don't hold a whole lot of joy
when you're nothing but a river boy
river boy river boy
a good for nothing river boy
river boy
[verse 1]
won't you come along with me
to the mississippi
we'll take the boat to the land of dreams
steam down the river down to new orleans
the band's there to meet us
and old friends to greet us
where all the people always meet
heaven on earth they call it basin street
basin street is the street
where the elite always meet
down in new orleans the land of dreams
you'll never know how nice it seems
or just how much it really means
just to be oh yes-sir-ee
where welcome's free are dear to me
where I can lose
my basin street blues
[verse 2]
ain't you glad you came with me
way down to the mississippi
we took the boat to the land of dreams
steam down the river to new orleans
basin street is the street
where the elite always meet
down in new orleans the land of dreams
you'll never know how nice it seems
or just how much it really means
just to be oh yes-sir-ee
where welcome's free are dear to me
where I can lose
my basin street blues
[verse 1]
i'm a game that you used to play
and I'm a plan that you didn't lay so well
i'm a fire that burns in your mind
close your eyes
i'm a memory
[verse 2]
i'm a love that you bought for a song
and I'm a voice on a green telephone
and I'm a day that lasted so long
close your eyes
i'm a memory
[verse 2]
i'm a dream that comes in the night
and I'm a face that fades with the light
and I'm a tear that falls out of sight
close your eyes
i'm a memory
now here we are
standing where the highways cross
and here we are saying goodbye
just another love lost in the great divide
here we are acting like two crazy kids
we've come too far to ever see it end like this
just another love lost in the great divide
remember how we used to dance together
remember how I used to hold you tight
you asked me if I'd leave and I said never
and that's still right
summer sun no prettier than summer rain
summer gone summer coming back again
other loves lost in the great divide [x2]
other loves lost in the great divide
[verse 1]
i'm just one step before losing you
and I'm just one step ahead of the blues
but I know that there's been pain and misery
long before this old world had ever heard of me
it will hurt to see you go
but we'll just add one more heartache to the score
and though I still love you as before
i'm just one step beyond caring anymore
[verse 2]
yes bet you're surprised that I could feel this way
after staying home and waiting night and day
for someone who cared so much for me
you'd come home just long enough to laugh at me
i don't know just when my feelings changed
i just know I could never feel the same
and though I still love you as before
i'm just one step beyond caring anymore
[verse 1]
i wake up in the morning with my arms around my pillow
then suddenly I realize I only hold a pillow
you're not there you're not there
[verse 2]
i call your name and hear my voice run searching through the hallway
to return alone confirming all I've known for so long
i'm alone you're still gone
[verse 3]
still half asleep I stumble to the kitchen for my coffee
my footsteps match my heartbeats funny heartbeats on linoleum
the sounds all wrong you're still gone
[verse 4]
the sounds outside reminding me the world won't wait forever
and understanding saves don't stand by empty graves
you're on your own all alone she's still gone
[verse 1]
i'll hang around until it's over
and hope that it never ends
and maybe in time you'll change your mind
and decide to love me again
i'll just simply refuse to leave you
call me stubborn but I'll never give in
and I'll hang around 'til it's over
and hope that it never ends
[instrumental break]
i'll just simply refuse to leave you
call me stubborn but I'll never give in
and I'll just hang around until it's over
and hope that it never ends
[verse 1]
i come home last saturday morning
i come home and found you gone
well there was a note tacked on my door
said your baby don't love you anymore
well I got dressed up and I went downtown
i got dressed up and I went downtown
well I walked up and I walked down
well there weren't no love there weren't no love around
there weren't no love around [8x]
[verse 2]
well I come home and I lay down
i felt my head spinning round and round
lord I poured my dreams
and I drank them down no there weren't no love
[chorus] [2x]
you could have your choice of guys at town
why are you picking on me
just snap your fingers and they'll come around
why are you picking on me
i'm well aware of this game you've learned
to love and then leave and show no concern
and tomorrow you'll have other candles to burn
so why are you picking on me
[piano & guitar]
you could have your choice
why are you picking on me
i lose my blues honey when I'm with you
no one else can do you're in my heart to stay
but when I'm gone and I'm all alone
i'll be singing a song I want to be with you always
i'd be happy dear if you could only be here and always be near forever and a day
we could travel far to some big shining star
just me and my guitar and stay that sweethearts for always
i lose my blues
today I stood across the street and watched you leave with him
right before my disbelieving eyes
and when you saw me standing there you turned away from me
and you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye
once you said you'd do almost anything to keep our love
you'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies
once you said you'd go to any lengths to be with me
today you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye
today I stood across the street and watched you leave with him
right before my disbelieving eyes
and when you saw me standing there you turned away from me
and you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye
once you said you'd do almost anything to keep our love
you'd tear out your tongue before you'd tell me lies
once you said you'd go to any lengths to be with me
today you wouldn't cross the street to say goodbye
it was a $1000 wedding supposed to be held the other day and
with all the invitations sent
the young bride went away
when the groom saw people passing notes
not unusual he might say
but where are the flowers for my baby
i'd even like to see her mean old mama
and why ain't there a funeral if you're gonna act that way
i hate to tell you how he acted when the news arrived
he took some friends out drinking and
it's lucky they survived
well he told them everything there was to
tell there along the way
and he felt so bad when he saw the traces
of old lies still on their faces
so why don't someone here just spike his drink
why don't you do him in some old way
supposed to be a funeral
it's been a bad bad day
the reverend dr william grace
was talking to the crowd
all about the sweet child's holy face and
the saints who sung out loud
and he swore the fiercest beasts
could all be put to sleep the same silly way
and where are the flowers for the girl
she only knew she loved the world
and why ain't there one lonely horn and one sad note to play
supposed to be a funeral
it's been a bad bad day
supposed to be a funeral
it's been a bad bad day
[verse 1]
i fell too hard and much too deep in love with you
i let you come and go at will it seems
you're back again this time you say forever
but I wonder just how long forever means
how long is forever this time
how long until one night you don't come home again
how long is forever this time
how long until I'm all alone again
[verse 2]
people say I'm foolish when I take you back
and it could be they're right but who can say
you'll be welcome here within my arms forever
even when forever ends for me today
how long is forever this time
how long until one night you don't come home again
how long is forever this time
how long until I'm all alone again
how long is forever this time
how long until one night you don't come home again
how long is forever this time
how long until I'm all alone again
how long until I'm all alone again
if I were a painting
captured on canvas
alone in the portrait I would stand
and brush strokes bold
yet soft as a whisper
the work of a feminine hand
caught in a still life
surrounded by shadows
and lost in a background of blue
if I were a painting
my price would be pain
and the artist would have to be you
i imagine the colors
would all run together
if you ever allowed me to cry
so don't paint the tears
just let me remember me
without you in my eyes
it's only the frame
that holds me together
or else I would be falling apart
if I were a painting
i wouldn't feel
and you wouldn't be breaking my heart
i realize the storm has just begun
[verse 1]
each night the raging storm clouds take away the moon above
and each day the same clouds take away the sun
my world is filled with darkness and I'm lost without your love
and I realize the storm has just begun
[verse 2]
can't you see the lighting flashing can't you hear the thunder roar
she's gone she's gone the damage has been done
there's a storm within my heart that keeps me crying night and day
and I realize the storm has just begun
[verse 3]
the sun was shining brightly on the day that we were wed
the day god made the two of us as one
but since the day you left me storm clouds gather overhead
and I realize the storm has just begun
[verse 4]
i don't want your help or pity I don't need your sympathy
all I want is you to be my only one
another night is coming and a long night it will be
and I realize the storm has just begun
sweet is the song when the song is love
love that has stood the test of time
and when you've heard all the songs of love
will you remember mine
gone are the times when I walked with you and held your hand in mine
now when you hold another's hand
will you remember mine
i have sat beneath the trees while the cool summer breeze
blew away the sands of time
and thought of days when you were near
remembering when you were mine
gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine
now when you kiss another's lips
will you remember mine
i have sat beneath the trees while the cool summer breeze
blew away the sands of time
and thought of days when you were near
remembering when you were mine
gone are the times when I held you close and pressed your lips to mine
now when you kiss another's lips
will you remember mine
[verse 1]
you taught me how to love with all my heart
with all my soul I trusted you
and now you say we'll have to live apart
a thing I don't know how to do
[verse 2]
you said someday I'd find somebody new
and I have not one regret
but stay a while if what you say is true
stay and teach me to forget
[verse 3]
you taught me how to worship you alone
and now you say you have to go
and people call me on the telephone
just to say "i told you so"
[verse 4]
i know now that I only learned to live
on the night when first we met
god above will teach me to forgive
but stay and teach me to forget
please stay and teach me to forget
i passed a home the other day
the yard was filled with kids at play
and on the sidewalk of this home
a little boy stood all alone
his smiling face was sweet and kind
but I could see the boy was blind
he listened to the children play
i bowed my head and there I prayed
dear lord above why must this be
and then these words came down to me
after all you're just a man
and it's not for you to understand
it's not for you to reason why
you too are blind without my eyes
so question not what I command
'cause it's not for you to understand
now when I pray my prayer is one
i pray his will not mine be done
after all I'm just a man
and it's not for me to understand
when it's sugarcane time
on around about june
i'll be walking with sugar
beneath that old sugar moon
[verse 1]
going to drop her a line
to expect me soon
said I'm craving some sugar
beneath that old sugar moon
i can see her right now
she'll get the calendar down
scratch a circle around
the day we're altar bound
when it's sugarcane time
on around about june
when the bells will be chiming
beneath that old sugar moon
when the sugar moon shines
on around about june
i'll be walking with sugar
beneath that old sugar moon
[verse 2]
all the kisses I've missed
i'll be getting it soon
sugar kisses from sugar
beneath that old sugar moon
while dreaming sweet dreams
all the loving I'll get
when I get back to my pet
lordy how I've []
walking with sugar
beneath that old sugar moon
[verse 1]
now that I've made up my mind you're gone
it should be easier now
perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on
it should be easier now
[verse 2]
the lesson I learned from you gold can't buy
a heart can be broken and still survive
thanks to you now a much wiser man am i
it should be easier now
[verse 3]
the worst now is over I've stood the test
it should be easier now
they say everything happens for the best
it should be easier now
[verse 4]
the wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide
hollowed and washed with the tears I've cried
but now there'll be more room for love inside
it should be easier now
busted flat in baton rouge headed for the trains feeling nearly faded as my jeans
bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained took us all the way to new orleans
i took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
and was blowing sad while bobby sang the blues
and with the windshield whispers slapping time
and bobby clapping hands we finally sang up every song that driver knew
freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
and nothing is worth nothing but it's free
feeling good was easy lord when bobby sang the blues
and body that was good enough for me good enough for me and bobby mcgee
from the coal mines of kentucky to the california sun
bobby shared the secrets of my soul
standing right beside me lord through everything I done
and every night she kept me from the cold
then somewhere near salinas lord I let her slip away
looking for the home I hope she'll find
and I'd trade all of my tomorrows for a single yesterday
holding bobby's body next to mine
freedom's just another word[]
[verse 1]
i was walking when the sun came up this morning
i was walking when the sun went down last night
cursing the day that I walked away
from the loved ones and friends I know in san antonio
[verse 2]
i was so intent in leaving home last fall
all the world was mine and I could feel the call
luring me on to places unknown
far from the hills of home back in san antone
i must admit I'm just a home boy
a san antone boy a far from home boy
i hear the call of san antonio
and that's where I plan to go
[verse 3]
fate has turned my back on all that I wanted so
now I know that I was never meant to roam
so I cursed the day that I walked away
as I return to stay in san antonio
san antonio san antonio
if you think I laugh louder than anyone here
if you think that my volume's too high
if you think I laugh louder you ain't heard nothin' yet
you ought to hear me cry
if you think I talk louder than maybe I should
well I guess I'm just that kind of guy
but if I talk loud and laugh loud you ain't heard it all
you ought to hear me cry
i go home to a home where love's almost gone
not enough to fill one needle's eye
then I sit down in a corner and I turn on the tears
and you ought to hear me cry
i go home to a home where love's almost gone
not enough to fill one needle's eye
then I sit down in a corner and I turn on the tears
and you ought to hear me cry
and you ought to hear me cry
[verse 1]
always too much whiskey
women that I never knew too well
all the things I've seen and done
most of which I'd be ashamed to tell
i don't know how it started
but that's what makes a man a man I guess
now I'm holding onto nothing
trying to forget the rest
i'm looking back on my life
to see if I can find the pieces
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well I've found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but the best parts I just threw away
[verse 2]
playing the bars playing like a star
anything to get a name
carrying on living on songs
that my friends wrote for me to sing
i'm looking back on my life
to see if I can find the pieces pieces of my life
i know that some were stolen
and some just blew away
well I've found the bad parts
found all the sad parts
but the best parts I just threw away
all the pieces of my life everywhere everywhere
and the one I miss most of all is you is you
[verse 1]
grandma's hands clapped in church on sunday morning
grandma's hands played the tambourine so well
grandma's hands used to issue out a warning
she'd say "billy don't you run so fast
might fall on a piece of glass
might be snaked there in that grass
grandma's hands
[verse 2]
grandma's hands sooth the local unwed mother
grandma's hands used to ache sometimes and swell
grandma's hands used to lift her face and tell her
she'd say "baby grandma understands
that you really loved that man
put yourself in jesus' hands
[verse 3]
grandma's hands used to hand me a piece of candy
grandma's hands picked me up each time I fell
grandma's hands boy the really came in handy
she'd say "mattie don't you whip that boy
what you want to spank him for
he didn't drop no apple core
but I don't have grandma anymore
if I get to heaven I'll look for
[verse 1]
tonight down here in the valley
i'm lonesome and oh how I feel
as I sit here alone in my cabin
i can see your mansion on the hill
[verse 2]
do you recall when we parted
the story to me you revealed
you said you could live without love dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill
[verse 3]
i've waited all through the years love
to give you a heart true and real
'cause I know that you're living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
[verse 4]
the light shines bright from your window
and the trees stand so silent and still
i know you're alone with your pride dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill
in your loveless mansion on the hill
[verse 1]
dashing through the snow
on a one-horse open sleigh
over the fields we go
laughing all the way
bells on bob-tail ring
making spirits bright
what fun it is to ride and sing
a sleighing song tonight
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
o what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
a day or two ago
i thought I'd take a ride
and soon miss fanny bright
was seated by my side
the horse was lean and lank
misfortune seemed his lot
he got into a drifted bank
and we we got upset
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
a day or two ago
i thought I'd take a ride
and soon miss fanny bright
was seated by my side
the horse was lean and lank
misfortune seemed his lot
he got into a drifted bank
and we we got upset
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
[verse 2]
now the ground is white
go it while you're young
take the girls tonight
and sing this sleighing song
just get a bob-tailed bay
two-forty as his speed
hitch him to an open sleigh
and crack you'll take the lead
jingle bells jingle bells
jingle all the way
what fun it is to ride
in a one-horse open sleigh
put some money in the jukebox
and let it play
for my heart is cold with its pain
take the cork from the bottle
of the warm red wine
and fill my glass up again
fill my glass to the brim
till it flows over the rim
like the tears flow in this heart of mine
and while I'll say so long
to the dreams that are gone
on account of the warm red wine
oh the prison of stone
with its cold iron bars
is no more a prison than mine
i'm a prisoner of drink
who will never escape
from the chains of the warm red wine
oh the wine is red
so warm and red
like the ribbon
it sparkles and shines
but I paid for the wine
that one red wine
with all of my hopes
and dreams
going to take a sentimental journey gonna set my heart at ease
going to make a sentimental journey to renew old memories
i got my fare got my reservation spent every dime I could afford
like a child in wild anticipation long to hear that all aboard
seven that's the time we leave at seven I'll be waiting up for heaven
counting every mile of railroad track that takes me back
i never thought my heart could be so yearny why did I decide to roam
i'm going to take a sentimental journey sentimental journey home
seven that's the time we leave
sentimental journey home
well there's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
nothin' can compare to it no matter how you try
nevada never closes new york city's got bright lights
but it's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
everybody's goin' san antonio on a saturday night
river walkin' talkin' western swingin' singin'
songs of love and yellow roses
there's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
it's honky tonkin' heaven underneath that lone star sky
you can lose your blues in mexico with their women and their wine
cause it's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
well there's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
nothing can compare to it no matter how you try
colorodo's mighty friendly with your rocky mountain high
but it's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
when the sun goes down it's time to paint the town
that's when you hear those fiddles play
from dallas to del rio and up to amarillo they'll be dancin' in the streets
loud and rowdy howdy howdy haughty lawdy
how I wish that I could be in abilene
there's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
nothing can compare to it no matter how you try
nevada never closes new york city's got bright lights
but it's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
but it's nothing quite like texas on a saturday night
[verse 1]
this is jimmy's road where jimmy liked to play
this is jimmy's grass where jimmy liked to lay around
[verse 2]
and this is jimmy's tree that jimmy likes to climb
but jimmy went to war and something changed his mind around
[verse 3]
this is the battleground where jimmy learned to kill
now jimmy has a trade and jimmy knows it well too well
[verse 4]
this is jimmy's grave where jimmy's body lies
and when a soldier falls jimmy's body dies and dies
[verse 1]
but this is jimmy's road where jimmy likes to play
this is jimmy's grass where jimmy likes to lay around
bows and flows of angel hair
ice cream castles in the air
and feathered canyons everywhere
i'd look at clouds that way
[verse 1]
now they only block the sun
they rain and snow on everyone
so many things I could have done
the clouds got in my way
i've looked at clouds from both sides now
from up and down and still somehow
it's cloud's illusions I recall
i really don't know cloud at all
[verse 2]
moons and junes and ferris wheels
dizzy dancing way you feel
as every fairy tale complete
i'd look at love that way
but now it's just another show
you leave them laughing when you go
and if you care don't let them know
don't give yourself away
[verse 1]
oh brother look what we’ve become
oh brother could we be so dumb
they set us up like dominos
i didn’t do it for no magazine
didn’t do it for no video
i didn't do it for no ceo
but I did it for real
i oulda done it for free
yeah I did it for me
'cause it was all that rang true
i did it for real and I did it for you
[verse 2]
i mighta done it for my sanity
maybe done it for my vanity
could be I did it for my my big ego
but I did it for real
i woulda done it for free
yeah I did it for me
'cause it was all that rang true
i did it for real and I did it for you
oh brother look what we’ve become
oh brother i’ve been overrun
only did it for the way it made me feel
oh but I did it for real
i woulda done it for free
yeah I did it for me
'cause it was all that rang true
i did it for real and I did it for you
[verse 1]
i'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
and the first to say be happy if you can
but to lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
do you mind too much if I don't understand
[verse 2]
i suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
i guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
but do you mind too much if I don't understand
[verse 3]
forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
and my heart and me we'd made so many plans
but that's all over now and there's nothing left to do
but do you mind too much if I don't understand
do you mind too much if I don't understand
i am a roving cowboy riding all alone
and for such a roving cowboy I've sure made myself at home
i love your sunshine I love your flowers I love your ocean rolling in
and for such a roving cowboy I've sure found myself a friend
i am a cowboy I am a sailor I have drifted far and wide
i have crossed the seven oceans I have crossed the great divide
but if you're ever looking for me let me tell you where I'll be
i'll be somewhere soaking up sunshine on my island in the sea
always seem to get things wrong
i waited here a bit too long
for you to come along to me
i thought that I would kiss your lips
but the sky went dark and the moon eclipsed
and what I missed is all that I can see
now I'm stuck here looking back
at where I lost the thread
so ashamed here thinking back
at how I lost my head
way back when the world was young
long before this song was sung
i know someone must have hurt like me
now I'm stuck here looking back
at where I lost the thread
so ashamed here thinking back
at how I lost my head
way back when the world was young
long before this song was sung
i know someone must have hurt like me
i'm a roaming cowboy riding all day long
tumbleweeds around me sing their lonely song
nights underneath the prairie moon
i ride along and sing this tune
see them tumbling down
pledging their love to the ground
lonely but free I'll be found
drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
cares of the past are behind
nowhere to go but I'll find
just where the trail will wind
drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
i know when night has gone
that a new world's born at dawn
i'll keep rolling along
deep in my heart is a song
here on the range I belong
drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds
that's what they all tell me
that's what they say to me
your blue eyes your black eyelashes
the way you looked at life
in your funny way
i guess out of the blue
you won't cross my mind
and I'll get over you
your pale skin your sexy crooked teeth
the trouble you'd get in
in your clumsy way
i guess one afternoon
you won't cross my mind
and I'll get over you
i guess out of the blue
you won't cross my mind
and I'll get over you
shame shame on you
shame shame on you
you took my heart as a token
when returned it was broken
had your face shame on you
shame shame on you
shame shame on you
you took my car and my money
you done me wrong and that ain't funny
oh it's me shame on you
shame shame on you
shame shame on you
two can play your little game
you'll find out who was to blame
don't you hide shame on you
shame shame on you
shame shame on you
ran around with other guys
tried to lie when I got wise
foolish girl shame on you
shame shame on you
shame shame on you
can you hold your head up high
look at friends right in the eye
no you can't shame on you
[verse 1]
thanks for what a little love you gave to me
and thank you for my escape from misery
i searched and found heaven and then lost it again
i'm not sorry forgiving all my love to you
and if they ask if I still love you I'll have to say I do
[chorus 1]
my heart was dead and you've made it live and die again
and then they learn from my mistakes so thanks again
[verse 2]
my reason for existing is now reveal
i'm just here to show the world how blue a man could feel
[chorus 1]
[verse 1]
oh have you seen miss molly
her cheeks are rosy red
her lips are soft as satin and they taste like gingerbread
oh oh oh me oh my miss molly I'm in love with you
oh me oh my miss molly won't you say you love me too
[verse 2]
now when miss molly's smiling the sun is dim a spell
and when she laughs her voice is like a little silver bell
[verse 3]
i'll trade my horse and saddle
cow driving I'll resign
if only miss molly will say that she'll be mine
[verse 4]
now listen dear miss molly I've told you this before
and even though I told you so I'll tell you just once more
[verse 1]
the night that we met I heard music
the words started coming so I wrote her a song
she loved every line that flowed from my mouth
and I sang it to her all night long
it was easy to write about her blue eyes
and her sweet smile and her body
and her smile oh touching me
i made her mine with just a few lines
and a three quarter time melody
[chorus 1]
that's all there is to this song
the dream that she was has moved on
[chorus 2]
all the words to the verses are gone
that's all there is to this song
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2][x2]
[chorus 1]
i guess my heart just settled back to earth
[verse 1]
i rode a dream so wild and free for all that dream was worth
true love is both a blessing and a curse
[chorus 1]
[verse 2]
i remember what you said that night so long ago
the dream for you had ended and you let me know
so I bounced from sky to sky trying to keep the dream alive
but everything I did just made it worse
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2][x2]
songs our love created that I still sing
and every night we make the rafters ring
and tonight I'll sing for everything it's worth
for all the hearts that settle back to earth
and tonight I'll sing for everything it's worth
for all the hearts that settle back to earth
[verse 1]
i love you so much I can't let you go
and sometimes I believe you love me
but somewhere between your heart and mine
there's a door without any key
somewhere between your heart and mine
there's a window that I can't see through
there's a wall so high it reaches the sky
somewhere between me and you
[verse 2]
somewhere between your heart and mine
there's a love I can't understand
it's there for a while then it fades like a smile
and I'm left in the middle again
take her to heart
and she'll always love you
and nobody can make her do wrong
but take her for granted
leaving your love un-shown
makes will power weak
and temptation strong
a woman's only human
this you should understand
she's not just a plaything
she's flesh and blood
just like her man
and if you want
a do right all day's woman
you got to be
a do right all night's man
this you should understand
she's not just a plaything
she's flesh and blood
just like her man
and if you want
a do right all day's woman
you got to be
a do right all night's man
[verse 1]
if you need some advice in being lonely
if you need a little help in feeling blue
if you need some advice on how to cry all night
come to me I'm the man with the blues
[verse 2]
i'm the man with a hundred thousand heartaches
and I've got most any color of the blues
so if you need a little shove in fouling up in love
come to me I'm the man with the blues
[instrumental break]
[verse 1]
if you need some advice in being lonely
if you need a little help in feeling blue
if you need some advice on how to cry all night
come to me I'm the man with the blues
[verse 2]
i'm the man with a hundred thousand heartaches
and I've got most any color of the blues
so if you need a little shove in fouling up in love
come to me I'm the man with the blues
was it something I did lord a lifetime ago
am I just now repaying a debt that I owe
justice sweet justice you travel so slow
but you can't change my love for the rose
old man sunshine listen you
never tell me dreams come true
just try it and I'll start a riot
beatrice fairfax don't you dare
ever tell me she will care
i'm certain it's the final curtain
don't want to hear from and cheerful pollyannas
who tell me love will find a way it's all bananas
they're writing songs of love but not for me
a lucky star's above but not for me
with love to lead the way
i found more clouds of gray
than any russian play could guarantee
i was a fool to fall and get that way
hi ho alas and also lack a day
although I can't dismiss
the memory of her kiss
i guess she's not for me
it all began so well but what an end
this is the time a fella needs a friend
when every happy plot
ends in a marriage knot
and there's no knot for me
[verse 1]
each time you hurt me you say you're sorry
i try to understand and say okay
but there must be an end to understanding
and the end of mine can't be too far away
[verse 2]
i try to understand you're only human
and we all make mistakes every day
but there must be an end to understanding
and I know that I just can't go on this way
[verse 3]
don't you know that love and understanding go together
ask too much of one and both will die
and there must be an end to understanding
and I know someday I'll reach the end of mine
and I know someday I'll reach the end of mine
it was just a neighborhood dance that's all what it was
but oh what it seemed to be
it was like a masquerade ball with costumes and all
cause you were at the dance with me
it was just a ride on the train that's all that it was
but oh what it seemed to be
it was like a trip to the stars to venus and mars
cause you were on the train with me
and when I kissed you darling it was more than just a thrill for me
it was a promise darling of the things that fate had willed for me
it was just a wedding in june that's all that it was
but oh what it seemed to be
it was like a royal affair with everyone there
cause you said "yes I do" to me
[verse 1]
i love you because you understand dear
every single thing I try to do
and you're always there to lend a helping hand dear
but most of all I love you 'cause you're you
no matter what the world may say about me
i know your love will always see me through
i love you for the way you never doubt me
but most of all I love you 'cause you're you
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
i love you because my heart is lighter
every time I'm walking by your side
and I love you because the future's brighter
the door to happiness you opened wide
no matter what may be the style or season
i know your love will always see me through
i love you for a hundred thousand reasons
but most of all I love you 'cause you're you
[verse 1 willie nelson]
you must remember this
a kiss is still a kiss
a sigh is just a sigh
the fundamental things apply
as time goes by
[verse 2 julio iglesias]
and when two lovers woo
they still say "i love you"
on that you can rely
no matter what the future brings
as time goes by
[chorus willie & julio]
moonlight and love songs
never out of date
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
well it's still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
moonlight and love songs
never out of date
hearts full of passion
jealousy and hate
woman needs man
and man must have his mate
that no one can deny
well it's still the same old story
a fight for love and glory
a case of do or die
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
[outro willie]
the world will always welcome lovers
as time goes by
so you saw her last night with her new love
yes they tell me they make quite a pair
and that they both look happy together
i just wonder not that I care
tell me was she lovely as ever
like an angel with golden hair
does she still close her eyes when she dances
i just wonder not that I care
once I thought I couldn't live without her
funny how wrong I could be
now I never ever think about her
what she does doesn't mean a thing to me
well it's late so I guess I'll be going
too much smoke what I need is some air
by the way did she ask you about me
i just wonder not that I care
i just wonder not that I care
[verse 1]
birds flying south to the one I love
birds flying high and free
don't tell my darling that you saw me
looking the way you see me
[verse 2]
winds blowing warm to the one I love
winds please kiss her for me
don't tell my darling that you saw me
looking the way you see me
[verse 3]
the way you see me is how I've been
and how ever since she's been gone
but tell her you saw me like I'd like to be
tell her I'm happy alone
[verse 4]
river of tears that I have cried
river flow on to the sea
but if you tell my darling you flowed from my eyes
she'd see me the way you see me
she'd see me the way you see me
[verse 1]
someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
someday you'll reach for me I won't be there
for you've grown tired of all the love I gave you
but someday you'll wish that I still cared
[verse 2]
all through the years how I have loved you
still I hope I claimed you for my own
someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
for someday you'll find yourself alone
someday you'll call my name and I won't answer
for someday you'll find yourself alone
i'll be loving you always with a love that's true always
when the things you've planned need a helping hand
i will understand always always
days may not be fair always that's when I'll be there always
not for just an hour not for just a day not for just a year but always keyboards
not for just a year but always
[chorus 1 willie nelson]
i just thought that you would like to know
that I would do anything just to make your dreams
just to make your dreams come true
[verse 1 norah]
well I just thought that you would like to know
that I I would climb the highest tree
just to make your dreams just to make your dreams come true
[verse 2 willie nelson]
i know that it seems like I am full of hot air
but my heart is in the right place
i swear I swear
[verse 3 norah]
i just thought that you would like to know
that I I would do anything
just to make just to make your dreams come true
[chorus 2 willie nelson and norah jones]
now I know that it seems like im full of hot air
but my heart
my heart is in the right place
i swear I swear
[chorus 1 norah]
and I just thought that you would like to know
that I I'd do anything
anything just to make your dreams
[bridge willie]
just to make your dreams come true
[outro willie nelson & norah jones]
just to make your dreams just to make your dreams
come true
bells will be ringing
the glad glad news

to wish me greetings
ooh once again

silent night
christmas carols
by candlelight

by new year's night
there'll be
no more sorrow
no grief and pain
and I'll be happy
happy once again
i took on more than I could handle
i bit off more than I could chew
i hit the wall
i went off like a roman candle
burning everyone I knew
i hit the wall
i hit the wall
and the wall came down
crashing down
and there was not a sound
half my life riding on a rocket
from one world to the next
and on and on
i hit the wall
taking things to make it make me better
remembering things I never knew I knew
i hit the wall
i hit the wall
and the wall came down
crashing down
and there was not a sound
and the wall came down
roaring crashing down
and there was not a sound
and the wall came down
crashing down
and there was not a sound
a past that's sprinkled with the blues
a few old dreams that I can't use
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
there were the smiles before the tears
and with the smiles some better years
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
when I remember how things were
my memories all leave her
i'd like to start my life anew
but memories just make me blue
a cottage small just built for two
a garden wall with violets blue
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
when I remember how things were
my memories all leave the girl
i'd like to start my life anew
but memories just make me blue
a cottage small just built for two
a garden wall with violets blue
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
who'll buy my mem'ries of things that used to be
holy moses I have been removed
i have seen the specter he has been here too
distant cousin from down the line
brand of people who ain't my kind
holy moses I have been removed
holy moses I have been deceived
now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
holy moses I have been deceived
i'm going back to the border
where my affairs my affairs ain't abused
i can't take any more bad water
i've been poisoned from my head down to my shoes
holy moses I have been deceived
holy moses let us live in peace
let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
there's a man over there what's his color I don't care
he's my brother let us live in peace
he's my brother let us live in peace
he's my brother let us live let us live in peace
[verse 1]
who put my alice in dallas
who put my ann in san antone
who took my gal down in galveston
she never ever came back home
texas I don't know what you've got
but whatever it is you sure have got a lot
who put all my ex's in texas
who took all my gals away from me
[verse 2]
one had a beau down in beaumont
another fell in wichita falls
i lost my abby down in abilene
now she never even calls
texas I don't know what you've got
but whatever it is you sure have got a lot
who put all my ex's in texas
who took my gals away from me
[verse 3]
who made the pass in el paso
that's where I lost one or two
who put amour in amarillo
in houston fort worth and corpus christi too
texas I don't know what you've got
but whatever it is you sure have got a lot
who put all my ex's in texas
who took all my gals away from me
who took all my gals away from me
discontent you must leave
leaving love leaving me
so go away for your dreams to come true
but should young dreams grow old
and warm friendships grow cold
there'll be someone waiting for you
and if you ever find
that fate is unkind
an' the devil starts taking his dues
when your fair weather friends
leave when fair weather ends
there'll be someone waiting for you
you'll always have someone who loves you
you're never alone don't you see
and when your world's slowing down
you'll need someone around
let that someone always be me
[chorus 1]
i'm going to kansas city baby
kansas city here I come
i'm going to kansas city baby
kansas city here I come
they got some mighty pretty women there
and I'm gonna get me one
[verse 1]
i'm gonna be standing on the corner
the corner of 12th street and vine
i'm gonna be standing on the corner
the corner of 12th street and vine
with my kansas city baby
and a jug of that kansas city wine
[chorus 2]
well I might take a boat
i might take a train
but if I have to walk you know
i'm going there just the same
[chorus 1]
i'm going to kansas city baby
kansas city here I come
they got some mighty pretty women there
and I'm gonna get me one
they got some mighty pretty women there
and I'm gonna get me one
[chorus 2]
well I might take a boat
i might take a train
but if I have to walk you know
i'm going there just the same
[verse 1]
far across deep blue water lives an old german's daughter
by the banks of the old river rhine
where I loved her and left her now I can't forget her
i miss my pretty fraulein
fraulein fraulein walk down by the river
pretend that your hand's holding mine
by the same stars above you I swear that I love you
you are my pretty fraulein
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
when my memories wander away over yonder
to the sweetheart that I left behind
in a moment of glory a face comes before me
the face of my pretty fraulein
fraulein fraulein look up toward the heavens
each night when the stars start to shine
by the same stars above you I swear that I love you
you are my pretty fraulein
we get to break out of prison
make love to our best friends wife
have a beer for breakfast in boston
drink rum in jamaica that night
we get to tell all our secrets
in a code no one understands
we get to shoot all the bad guys
but never get blood on our hands
we're hero's we're schemers
we're drunks and we're dreamers
we're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
we're students we're teachers
we're the devil we're preachers
we're true love but mostly one nighters
we're the songwriters
half the world thinks we're crazy
the other half wants to be us
and the're jealous because we get to hang out
in the back of some big stars tour bus
we're old boots and tee shirts and blue jeans
we're cables and strings and e chords
we only dress up in november
when they hand out some writers awards
we're hero's we're schemers
we're drunks and we're dreamers
we're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
we're the truths we're the lies
we're stupid we're wise
we're true love but mostly one nighters
we're the songwriters
we ride bridges we cross em and burn em
teach lessons but don't bother to learn em
our mama's don't know what we're doing
why we stay out all night long
i told mine I was a drug dealer
she said thank god you ain't writin songs
we're heros we're schemers
we're drunks and we're dreamers
we're lovers and sometimes we're fighters
we're the truths we're the lies
we're stupid we're wise
we're true love but mostly one nighters
we're the songwriters
we're the songwriters
if I had the heart of a clown
i'd laugh every time you made me blue
if I had the heart of a clown
you wouldn't see me cry the way you do
and I'd paint a smile upon my face
each time you hurt me so
my arms could long for your embrace
but you would never know
and I'd sing as my dream world tumbled down
if I had the heart of a clown
this is the waiting time I wait for you
while you make up your mind just what you wanna do
they say that things worthwhile are worth waiting for
and you're worth so much to me I'll wait for ever more
there was a hurting time I hurt you so
then came the parting time I watched you go
but you said perhaps in time our love could still be
so this is the waiting time and I'll just wait and see
there was a hurting time I hurt you so
then came the parting time I watched you go
but you said perhaps in time our love could still be
so this is the waiting time and I'll just wait and see
[verse 1]
just one more dance just one more chance
so I can talk to you
don't live too fast forget the past
and I will try to prove
i would do anything you want me to
don't run around don't paint the town
let me talk to you
[verse 2]
don't go too far with that crowd at the bar
that's not the way to win please fall in love again
give me your heart so I can start
to build our life anew
i know you've paid so if you're afraid
let me talk to you
[verse 1]
i see nothing to be gained by explanations
no need to try to say who's right or who was wrong
no need to enter into lengthy dissertations
to make a long story short she's gone
[verse 2]
i won't attempt to explain the things that happened
to put in words why she's not here would take too long
and it's all too far beyond the realm of understanding
to make a long story short she's gone
[verse 3]
the way you look at me you don't believe she loved me
but she once loved me with a love so sweet and strong
i won't try to give the reasons why I miss her so
to make a long story short she's gone
to make a long story short she's gone
the streets are dark and quiet at london after midnight
the silence is the master of darkness and london can sleep tonight
protected by the master
london london
you scream the largest portion of the day
london london
rest your lungs tomorrow's on its way
[verse 1]
the music stopped
the crowd is thinning now
one phase of night
has reached an ending now
and nothing nothing lasts forever
except forever and you my love
and so will you my love my love
[verse 2]
the street is dark here
here while I walk along
and since you've gone
i always walk alone
'cause nothing nothing lasts forever
except forever and you my love
and so will you my love my love
and so will you my love
your memory is always near
wherever I am found
your memory is still around
[verse 3]
the dawn and i
arrive at home at last
night turns it's lonely face
toward the past
'cause nothing nothing lasts forever
except forever and you my love
and so will you my love my love
[verse 1]
what used to be my home has changed to just a place to stay
a crumbling last resort when day is through
sometimes between sundown and dawn somehow I find my way
to this home motel on lost love avenue
[verse 2]
no one seems to really care if I come here at all
and the one who seems to care the least is you
i'm gonna hang a neon sign with letters big and blue
home motel on lost love avenue
[verse 1]
i was looking for america in a western movie
saw a young gun slinger with something to prove
and I came looking like anybody else
i came searchinglike anybody else
looking for that golden calf
and I came shooting for the stars like any young blood
i found a fat cat city and crooked judge
i killed anything standing in my path
i killed anything till I laid my hands
laid' em on the golden calf
now it's our last stand in open country
this is my last chance to be with you
this is the last dance for this kind of man
i'm still looking for something to prove
[verse 2]
i come around full circle aged like an old dog
looking at them young bucks just green as frogs
but I ain't laying back no time to laugh
i ain't laying back
there's new kids a coming gunning for that golden calf
i was was looking for america in a western movie
i saw pike bishop striding through aqua verde
he was heading down that dusty path
heading down that blood path
running from his crooked past
hes looking for another life
sick of chasing down that golden calf
but there's always someone faster
someone quicker on the draw
someone with a hunger closing in
some younger stepping up to be
the next out law
oh I'm still looking for something to prove
this is our last stand[x4]
i can't begin to tell you
how much you mean to me
my world would end if ever we were through
i can't begin to tell you
how happy I would be
if I could speak my mind like others do
i make such pretty speeches
whenever we're apart
but when your near
the words I choose
refuse to leave my heart
so take the sweetest phrases
the world has ever known
and make believe
i've said them all to you
i make such pretty speeches
whenever we're apart
but when your near
the words I choose
refuse to leave my heart
so take the sweetest phrases
the world has ever known
and make believe
i've said them all to you
[verse 1]
i've been throwing horseshoes
over my left shoulder
i've spent most all my life
searching for that four leaf clover
yet you run with me
chasing my rainbows
[chorus 1]
honey I love you too
that's the way love goes
that's the way love goes
[verse 2]
babe that's the music god made
for the whole wide world to sing
it never gets old
it always grows
losing makes me sorry
you say don't you worry
[chorus 1]
[verse 1]
well you seem a little colder when I say I must be leaving
but it's an ugly way for us to let it end
what's the use in being worried 'cause I'm going in an hour
when the time is running out that we can spend
what's the difference being different when it's difference now that looks alike
you say I'm changing I'm not sure that's wrong
it's just today it may be natural sitting here discussing it
tomorrow just as natural to be gone
[instrumental break]
[verse 2]
there's no season in my mind that I can count on for an answer
and I dug too many holes expecting snow
i'm not sure to where I'm headed how I'll ride or who I'm with
if I return or when I think I might go
what's the difference being different when it's difference now that looks alike
you say I'm changing I'm not sure that's wrong
it's just today it may be natural sitting here discussing it
tomorrow just as natural to be gone
imagine there's no heaven
it's easy if you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imagine all the people
living for today
imagine there's no countries
it isn't hard to do
nothing to kill or die for
and no religion too
imagine all the people
living life in peace yoohoo
you may say I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world will be as one
imagine no possessions
i wonder if you can
no need for greed or hunger
a brotherhood of man
imagine all the people
sharing all the world yoohoo
you may say I'm a dreamer
but I'm not the only one
i hope someday you'll join us
and the world will live as one
[verse 1]
i've searched through each moment of each passing hour
but your memory grows stronger I find
oh they tell me in time I'll forget you
but somehow I can't find the time
[verse 2]
they tell me in time I'll find another
and happiness again will be mine
oh they tell me in time I'll forget you
but somehow I can't find the time
something each moment reminds me of you
you always end up on my mind
oh they tell me in time I'll forget you
but somehow I can't find the time
something each moment reminds me of you
you always end up on my mind
oh they tell me in time I'll forget you
but somehow I can't find the time
there is a fountain
filled with blood drawn from emmanuel’s veins
and sinners plunged beneath that flood
lose all their guilty stains[x3]
the dying thief rejoiced to see
that fountain in his day
and there may I though vile as he
wash all my sins away[x3]
and there may I though vile as he
wash all my sins away
e’er since by faith I saw the stream
thy flowing wounds supply
redeeming love has been my theme
and shall be till I die[x3]
redeeming love has been my theme
and shall be till I die[x2]
[verse 1]
this is the first time that I've ever had this much time
to sit and watch the grass grow and wonder why you left me
and oh I've often wondered how I would take this feeling
that I'm feeling today would it really be despair if you ever went away
so this is how without you goes
watching re-runs of old memory shows
even at my best the worst is yet to come
god knows this is how without you goes
[verse 2]
i never thought that I would sit and watch the sunrise
and not care if there were blue skies because you were always with me
but now we're not together and come fair or stormy weather
everything is tear clouds and no matter what I do
they keep falling from me now
so this is how without you goes
watching re-runs of old memory shows
and even at my best the worst is yet to come
god knows this is how without you goes
so this is how without you goes
[verse 1]
your watching your watch and I know what's on your mind
there's someone home waiting and you're away over time
what should be so right is as wrong as can be
go on home you don't belong here with me
[verse 2]
i love you I love you I love only you
but the one home who's waiting he loves you too
he's worried and he's wondering where can you be
go on home you don't belong here with me
[verse 3]
go on home you don't belong here with me
though I want you and I need you desperately
but to hide here in the darkness is as wrong as can be
go on home you don't belong here with me
go on home you don't belong here with me
i thought if I could be with you maybe I'd feel better
but I'm afraid I took advantage of your love
i thought if you'd just hold me tight maybe I'd forget her
but I don't suppose as yet you've held me tight enough
please hold me tighter I still remember
put your arms around me hold me close hold me tight and long
please hold me tighter I still remember
and I can't love again until her memory's gone
please hold me tighter I still remember
put your arms around me hold me close hold me tight and long
please hold me tighter I still remember
and I can't love again until her memory's gone
by the rivers of babylon
where he sat down
and there he wept
when he remembered zion
but the wicked carried us away in captivity
requiring from us a song
how can we sing king alpha song
in a strange land
so let the words of our mouth
and the meditation of our heart
be acceptable in thy sight oh far i
[verse 1 willie nelson]
well I'm going tell you baby
we'll move away from here
gonna sell my icebox and buy me a frigidaire
when we move out on the outskirts of town
cause I don't want nobody foolin' or always hanging round
it may sound funny honey funny as it can be
if we ever have any children
i want 'em all to look like me
when we move way out on the outskirts of town
cause I don't want nobody fooling there always hanging round
[verse 2 keb' mo']
i'm going bring me own grocery
i'm going bring 'em everyday
i don't like that grocery boy
i gotta keep him away
when we move way out on the outskirts of town
no no I don't want nobody always hanging round
well now I don't want nobody always hanging round
[verse 1]
i made myself a promise the day you put me down
that I wouldn't see you if you came around
but here you are within my arms the way you used to be
and I broke the promise that I made to me
[verse 2]
they told me you were at a dance and I prepared to go
i made myself a promise that I'd only say hello
i knew you'd only hurt me but it's such sweet misery
so I broke the promise that I made to me
a broken promise always means someone will surely cry
and I know who that someone's bound to be
and tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie
and broke the promise that I made to me
a broken promise always means someone will surely cry
and I know who that someone's bound to be
and tomorrow I'll be sorry that I told myself a lie
and broke the promise that I made to me
last evening I turned by the pages of time
and tore out the chapters when you were mine
i attempted to cut out the memories of you
and paste in some new ones far better an' true
i searched through the chapters referring to hearts
for the one with the caption "till death do us part"
i ripped at each letter an' I tore at each word
i screamed at your memory an' nobody heard
nobody heard
but your memory's determined and chances are few
of my ever finding a replacement for you
it depserately clings to the floor of my mind
and fights for its place in the pages of time
[verse 1]
mama let me bring your old harmonica to you
i'll get out my guitar and we'll play a song or two
we'll let the music take us back to when I was a kid
take our minds of everything in the way it always did
we'll play "you are my sunshine" we'll do "amazing grace
we'll stop and catch our breath and let our laughter fill this place
and it's too bad with all the family dad's not here to play along
we'll get back together and it won't be very long
[verse 2]
will the circle be unbroken you always said it would
and we'll all meet again someday and feel it like we should
when the room is cold up yonder and tawnyoo is no more
we'll be shouting and a singing precious memories to the lord
when we get back together and it won't be very long
there is a peaceful solution it's called a peace revolution
now let's take back america
there's a war and we're in it but I know we can win it
so let's take back america
it's a dream so believe it
now get ready to receive it
and let's take back america
and when the war is over and we've won it
let's remember how we done it so we don't have to do it again
there is a peaceful solution it's called a peace revolution
now let's take back america
there's a war and we're in it but I know we can win it
now let's take back america
there was a peace resolution
and a peaceful revolution
and the peaceful solution saved america
what there was left of us
was all covered in dust and thick skin
a half-eaten apple
or the whole sistine chapel
painted on the head of a pin
a lifelong love's work
gone up in a smirk
and you didn't even see her waltz in
now this love is a ghost
for having played host
to the most unoriginal sin
at the wedding we smiled
as some devil played wild violin
soon after the chapel
she offered me that apple
one bite and I was gone with the wind
and you needed no proof
because the whole naked truth
was wearing only an infidel's grin
and a proud schoolboy's boast
for having left his post
for the most unoriginal sin
now the jukebox is humming
all the venal shortcomings of men
but I found me this drink
that can finally sink
all this guilt that I've been wallowing in
buddy once you get started
once true love's departed
you do it over and over again
so tonight I will toast
just whoever comes close
to the most unoriginal sin
so tonight I will toast
just whoever comes close
to the most unoriginal sin
it's a dream come true
i can't believe that it's just me and you
seeing worlds so far apart
come together in our hearts
it's a dream come true
it's a dream come true
there is nothing that a dream can't do
i dreamed of love and I was given you
you're a dream come true
these are changing times
a universe within our minds
with all the power of a love divine
it's a dream come true
it's a symphony
and all the notes ring out in harmony
it's the music of the stars
it fulfills all my desires
it's a dream come true
it's the music of the stars
it fulfills all my desires
it's a dream come true
who's sorry now who's sorry now
whose heart is aching for breaking each vow
who's sad and blue who's crying too
just like I cried over you
right to the end just like a friend
i tried to warn you somehow
you had your way now you must pay
i'm glad that you're sorry now
right to the end just like a friend
i tried to warn you somehow
you had your way now you must pay
i'm glad that you're sorry now
right to the end just like a friend
i tried to warn you somehow
you had your way now you must pay
i'm glad that you're sorry now
right to the end just like a friend
i tried to warn you somehow
you had your way now you must pay
i'm glad that you're sorry now
i gotta get over you again
i gotta get over you again
i had my heart wide open
and you just walked right on back in
[verse 1]
you can't imagine
just how hard it's been
now I gotta get over you
i gotta get over you again
we never really had a chance
we never really had a chance at all
i was carrying more luggage
than u-haul truck could haul
and I had it all worked out
we'd only be the best of friends
now I gotta get over you
i gotta get over you again
maybe I never really got over you at all
[verse 2]
and I've been looking in the mirror
lying like a dog
supposed to be so easy
like falling off a log
and I started thinking
thinking about things that might have been
now I gotta get over you
i gotta get over you again
and I gotta get over you
i gotta get over you again
i had my heart wide open
and you just walked right on back in
and I gotta get over you
i gotta get over you again
[verse 1]
i'd like to rush into somebody's arms and lose myself inside
but just any arms won't do they must belong to you
i'd like to know the soothing comfort of a love that never dies
but just any old love won't do that love must come from you
[verse 2]
i've tried so hard to find someone to love since I lost you
but they only make me realize how much that I need you
i'd like to know when I grow older someone's heart will still be true
but just any old heart won't do it must belong to you
i've tried so hard to find someone to love since I lost you
but they only make me realize how much that I need you
and I'd like to know when I grow older someone's heart will still be true
but just any old heart won't do it must belong to you
[verse 1]
if we're backing up it's just to get a running start
because everything we do we do with all our hearts
and it don't really matter what they say
we wouldn't have it any other way
we play our songs and play our old guitars
and it don't really matter where we are
we wake up in a new world every day
and we wouldn't have it any other way
we wouldn't have it any other way
and it don't really matter what they say
we wake up in a new world every day
and we wouldn't have it any other way
[verse 2]
and when it's time for us to move along
to a place we sometimes sing of in our songs
raise your glasses high on that fine day
because we wouldn't have it any other way
we wouldn't have it any other way
and it don't really matter what they say
we wake up in a new world every day
and we wouldn't have it any other way
we wouldn't have it any other way
[verse 1]
now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold
with the ways of a gentleman I've been told
a kind of a fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea
but if me and a certain character met
that guy that invented the cigarette
i'd murder that son of a gun in the first degree
that ain't that I don't smoke myself
and I don't reckon they'll injure your health
i've smoked them all my life and I ain't dead yet
but nicotine slaves are all the same
at a pheasant party or a poker game
everything's got to stop when they have that cigarette
smoke smoke smoke that cigarette
puff puff puff
and if you smoke yourself to death
tell st peter at the golden gate
that you hate to make him wait
but you just got to have another cigarette
[verse 2]
now at a game of chance the other night
old dame forson wasn't doing me right
them kings and queens just kept on coming round
well I got a full and I bet it high
but my plug didn't work on a certain guy
he just kept a rising and a laying that money down
he's raise me and I'd raise him
i sweated blood I had to sink or swim
he finally called and he didn't raise the bet
i said "aces is full pal how about you"
he said "i'll tell you in a minute or two
but I just got to have another cigarette"
[verse 3]
the other night I had a date with
the cutest girl in the fifty states
a highbred uptown social little dame
she said she loved me and it seemed to me
that things were like they ought to be
so hand in hand we strolled down lover's lane
she was oh so far from a chunk of ice
and our smooching party was a going real nice
so help and I think I'd've been there yet
but I give her a hug and a little squeeze
and she said "willie excuse me please
but I just got to have another cigarette"
[chorus] [2x]
just got to have another cigarette
[verse 1]
i just dropped by to see the house I used to live in
i hope that you don't mind I won't stay very long
so long ago someone and I lived here together
and then so suddenly I found myself alone
[verse 2]
i couldn't stand the thought of living here without her
and so I moved away to let my memories die
but my memories outlived my own judgement
this may sounds strange to you but I just thought I'd drop by
[verse 3]
the very door you're standing in she used to stand there
and wait for me to come home every night
and when I'd see her standing there I'd run to meet her
these things were on my mind so I just thought I'd drop by
[verse 4]
i guess that I should leave someone just might not understand
and I'm aware of how the neighbors like to pry
but you can tell them all today a most unhappy man
was in the neighborhood and he just thought he'd drop by
way out in reno nevada
where romance blooms and fades
a great philadelphia lawyer
was in love with a hollywood maid
"come love and we will wander
down where the lights are bright
i'll win you a divorce from your husband
and we can get married tonight"
now bill was a gun-totin' cowboy
ten notches were carved in his gun
and all the boys around reno
left wild bill's maiden alone
one night when bill was returning
from ridin' the range in the cold
he dreamed of his hollywood maiden
her love was as lasting as gold
as he drew near her window
a shadow he saw on the shade
it was the great philadelphia lawyer
makin' love to his hollywood maid
the night was as still as the desert
the moon was bright overhead
bill listened awhile to the lawyer
he could hear every word that he said
"your hands are so pretty and lovely
your form's so rare and divine
come go with me to the city
and leave this wild cowboy behind"
now back in old pennsylvania
among all those beautiful pines
there's one less philadelphia lawyer
in old philadelphia tonight
every time he drinks he thinks of her
but every morning her memory fades away
living is easy now but it just might get worse
cause every time he drinks he thinks of her
[verse 1]
but in the morning he wakes up with a smile
and the road still has him coming every mile
but the party life is dangerous when you left your love behind
cause it hides in every bottle that you find
[verse 2]
he thinks that he can live his life without her
and leave her love as easy as it came
if he keeps on drinking then his mind will keep on thinking
and his heart will die remembering her name
[verse 1]
i gotta run to keep from hiding
i'm bound to keep on riding
an' I got one more silver dollar
an' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me no
i ain't gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[verse 2]
well these ain't my clothes I'm wearing
an' this ol' road goes on forever
[verse 3]
well I've gone by the point of caring
some ol' bed I'll soon be sharing
[verse 1]
you don't think I'm funny anymore
you used to laugh at all my jokes
even though you'd heard them all before
but yoy think I'm funny anymore
i used to fake a heart attack
and fall down on the floor
but even I don't think that's funny anymore
i guess things change
and the more they change the more they stay the same
and there ain't no blame
sometimes the picture just don't fit the frame
and this is where the cowboy yields the floor
cause you don't think I'm funny anymore
did you hear the one about the dirty whore
oh I forgot you don't think I'm funny anymore
broken her heart
and I know I done wrong
but I pray
that someday she'll forgive me
and remember
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
i hope and I pray
she'll forgive me
and remember
when I've sang
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
when I've sang
my last hillbilly song
a rose must remain with the sun and the rain
or it's lovely promise won't come true
to each his own to each his own
and my own is you
what good is a song if the words just don't belong
and a dream must be a dream for two
no good alone to each his own
and my own is you
if a flame is to grow there must be a glow
to open each door there's a key
i need you I know I can't let you go
your touch means too much to me
two lips must insist and two more to be kissed
or they'll never know what love can do
to each his own I've found my own
one and only you
if a flame is to grow there must be a glow
to open each door there's a key
i need you I know I can't let you go
your touch means too much to me
two lips must insist and two more to be kissed
or they'll never know what love can do
to each his own I've found my own
one and only you
to each his own I've found my own
one and only you
i was just walkin' out the door
it's too bad you didn't come before
i've waited so long so long so long
now there's no time to wait anymore
how I cried for you day and night
for the letters that you wouldn't write
but now it's alright alright alright
you won't have to write anymore
not so long ago you will never know
what this day to me would have been
but it's all changed now
darling anyhow
it was nice to see you again
well it's almost a quarter to four
sorry I can't stay anymore
i must be on my way
it's my wedding day
and I was just walkin' out the door
well it's almost a quarter to four
sorry I can't stay anymore
i must be on my way
it's my wedding day
and I was just walkin' out the door
[verse 1]
the bottle is almost empty the clock just now struck ten
darling I had to call you to our favorite place again
we know it's wrong for us to meet but the fire's gone out at home
[chorus 1]
there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
[chorus 2]
love is where you find it when you find no love at home
and there's nothing cold as ashes after the fire is gone
[verse 2]
your lips are warm and tender your arms hold me just right
sweet words of love you remember that the one at home forgot
each time we say it's last time but we keep hanging on
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
[verse 1]
what can you do to me now
that you haven't done to me already
you broke my pride and made me cry out loud
what can you do to me now
[verse 2]
i'm seeing things that I never thought I'd see
you've opened up the eyes inside of me
how long have you been doing this to me
i'm seeing sides of me that I can't believe
someway somehow I'll make a man of me
i will build me back the way I used to be
much stronger now the second time around because
what can you do to me now
what can you do to me now
[verse 1]
god painted the bluebonnets in the fields
by a tough little scrub oak on an east texas hill
and he plucked the star from a lone star sky
and he put it in the twinkle of a cowboy's eye
the wide open spaces he made wild and free
texas as far as any eye can see
and he made her sons grow tough and strong
they still cry when they hear a sad song
no place but texas
would I ever roam
no place but texas
my home sweet home
no place but texas
my home sweet home
[verse 2]
when I die I hope they bury me
by the pedernales river beneath a white oak tree
where I can see the longhorns graze
and the cactus flowers blooming in the morning haze
no place but texas
would I ever roam
no place but texas
my home sweet home
no place but texas
my home sweet home
[verse 1]
many's the time I've been mistaken
and many times confused
yes and I've often felt forsaken
and certainly misused
oh but I'm alright I'm alright
just weary to my bones
still you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
so far away from home
so far away from home
[verse 2]
i don't know a soul who's not been battered
don't have a friend who feels at ease
i don't know a dream that's not been shattered
or driven to its knees
oh but it's alright it's alright
for we've lived so well so long
still when I think of the road we're travelin' on
i wonder what's gone wrong
i can't help it I wonder what's gone wrong
[verse 3]
and I dreamed I was dying
i dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
looking back down at me smiled reassuredly
i dreamed I was flying
high up above my eyes could clearly see
the statue of liberty sailing away to sea
and I dreamed I was flying
[verse 4]
we come on the ship they call the mayflower
come on the ship that sails the moon
we come in the age's most uncertain hours
and sing an american tune
oh but it's alright it's alright
can't be forever blessed
still tomorrow's gonna be another working day
and I try to get some rest
that's all I'm trying to get some rest
[outro guitar solo]
[verse 1]
may the lord's shining grace be yours love
may the happiest face be yours love
may the last fingertips
that touch these two lips
as life from me slips be yours love
[verse 2]
may the fruit of my toil be yours love
may the food from my soil be yours love
and from this moment on
may a love that is strong
and lives on and on be yours love
[verse 3]
may the sons that I raise be yours love
may the comforts that I praise be yours love
and if I ever get weak
may the love words I speak
and the arms that I seek be yours love
may the lord's shining grace
may the lord's shining grace
i got that old fashioned love in my heart
and there it will always remain
like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
through these years joys and tears just the same
i got that old fashioned faith in my heart
and nothing can tear it apart
dry land will turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
i got that old fashioned love in my heart
i got that old fashioned love in my heart
and there it will always remain
like an ivy clinging vine clinging closer all the time
through these years joys and tears just the same
i got that old fashioned faith in my heart
and nothing can tear it apart
dry land will turn to sea but there'll be no change in me
i got that old fashioned love in my heart
got that old fashioned love
i'll have a blue christmas without you
i'll be so blue thinking about you
decorations of red on a green christmas tree
won't mean a thing dear if you're not here with me
i'll have a blue christmas for certain
and when that blue blue heartache starts hurting
you'll be doing alright with your christmas of white
but I'll have a blue blue christmas
and when that blue blue heartache starts hurting
you'll be doing alright with your christmas of white
but I'll have a blue blue christmas
heavenly shades of night are falling
it's twilight time
out of the mist your voice is calling
it's twilight time
when purple coloured curtains
mark the end of day
i'll hear you my dear at twilight time
deepening shadows gather splendour
as day is done
fingers of night will soon surrender
the setting sun
i count the moments darling
till your here with me
together at last at twilight time
here in the afterglow of day
we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
and here in the same and sweet old way
i fall in love again as I did then
deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
like days of old
lighting the spark of love that fills me
with dreams untold
each day I pray for evening
just to be with you
together at last at twilight time
here in the afterglow of day
we keep our rendezvous beneath the blue
and here in the same and sweet old way
i fall in love again as I did then
deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me
like days of old
lighting the spark of love that fills me
with dreams untold
each day I pray for evening
just to be with you
together at last at twilight time
together at last at twilight time
[verse 1]
the sun just went behind the clouds
there's darkness all around me now
and I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
[verse 2]
i broke her heart so many times
and now at last I've broken mine
and I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
what made me think that I could go on hurting her
i had to known there had to be an end
but fools in love are taught by faith
we never learn 'til it's too late
and I've just destroyed the world I'm living in
[instrumental break]

just one love that shines for me
shines a light that I can see
just one love shines for me tonight
just one love shines for me tonight
just look at all those stars up in the sky
the wind is blowing through the trees
weather that's inside of me
makes a sound that follows me around
it makes a sound haunting me to hear
it blows me round and round when you are near
just one love
[verse 2]
well babe as far as I can see
stars are what they want to be
they want to be the one to make you smile
just a little love of your heart is all they need
just a little of your love could be for me
just look at all those stars up in the sky

i said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
i said move over once move over twice
come on baby don't be cold as ice

[verse 1]
you're hanging on his arm
she's holding mine
a fool must have said love was blind
we're shouting I love you's
with people all around
and they don't hear one sound
let her eyes do the talking
and her eyes do the walking
and her eyes do the slipping
around staring each other down
[verse 2]
and we're both on to
how long a slow song
would be for us now
this timebomb we're holding
is so near exploding right down
so let her eyes do the talking
and eyes do the walking
her eyes do the slipping
around staring each other down
staring each other down
[verse 1]
well I guess I been hanging around too long it's just about time I was moving along
but I'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
and don't you worry and don't you moan it's just about time I was moving along
but I'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
[verse 2]
i'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
i'm a going to leave this sinful world before the dawning
don't you worry and don't you moan it's just about time I was moving along
i'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
[verse 3]
and when I'm dead and you carry me away
don't you bury me deep because I isn't going to stay
i'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
just a little bit of dirt and a little bit of gravel
don't you weigh me down because you know I got to travel
i'm going to kneel at the feet of jesus in the morning
i'm going to kneel at the feet[]
i'm going to kneel at the feet[]
[verse 1]
i know not where on earth to find you
i know not how or when to start
i only know I'm here without you
i've got pins and needles in my heart
[verse 2]
the days and night are growing longer
since first you said that we must part
i only know I can't forget you
with these pins and needles in my heart
[verse 1]
what was it you wanted
tell me again so I'll know
what's happening in there
what's going on in your show
what was it you wanted
could you say it again
i'll be back in a minute
you can get it together by then
what was it you wanted
you can tell me I'm back
we can start it all over
get it back on the track
you got my attention
go ahead speak
what was it you wanted
when you were kissing my cheek
was there somebody looking
when you give me that kiss
someone there in the shadows
someone that I might have missed
is there something you needed
something I don't understand
what was it you wanted
do I have it here in my hand
whatever you wanted
slipped out of my mind
would you remind me again
if you'd be so kind
has the record been breaking
did the needle just skip
is there somebody waiting
was there a slip of the lip
[verse 2]
what was it you wanted
i ain't keeping score
are you the same person
that was here before
is it something important
maybe not
what was it you wanted
tell me again I forgot
whatever you wanted
what could it be
did somebody tell you
that you could get it from me
is it something that comes natural
is it easy to say
why do you want it
who are you anyway
[verse 3]
is the scenery changing
am I getting it wrong
is the whole thing going backwards
are they playing our song
where were you when it started
do you want it for free
what was it you wanted
are you talking to me
if I had my way dear forever there'd be
a garden of roses for you and for me
a thousand and one things dear I would do
just for you only you
if I had my way we would never grow old
and sunshine I'd bring every day
you would reign all alone like a
queen on a throne
if I had my way
up above me are the skies
like the twinkle in your eyes
there things are the color of the blues
in the mail your letter came
the ink and paper looked the same
blue must be the color of the blues
blue birds singing in the trees
seems to sympathize with me
for he's not singing like he use to do
the pretty water in the sea
still as cold as you left me
yes blue must be the color of the blues
there's a rainbow over head
with more blue than gold and red
blue must be the color angels choose
and the blue dress you proudly wore
when you left to return no more
blue must be the color of the blues
blue days come and blue days go
how I feel nobody knows
life is pretty empty without you
there's a blue note in each song
that I sing since you are gone
yes blue must be the color of the blues
because of you there's a song in my heart because of you my romance had its start
because of you the sun will shine the moon and stars will say you're mine
forever and never to part
i only live for your love and your kiss it's paradise to be near you like this
because of you my life is now worthwhile and I can smile because of you
i only live for your love and your kiss it's paradise to be near you like this
because of you my life is now worthwhile and I can smile because of you
[verse 1]
the children are sleeping our talk can begin
we've waited until they've gone to bed
we knew they would cry when we said goodbye
and I'd rather leave quietly instead
[verse 2]
we can never be happy we both know it's true
we've quarreled from the day that we met
our love was too weak to pull our dreams through
but too strong to let us forget
i hope we can salvage a few memories
to carry us through the long night
the clock's striking midnight yesterday's gone
and there's no tomorrow in sight
[verse 3]
in our efforts to break through the thick walls of pride
with harsh words that burned to the core
the wall's still remaining but the words broke inside
and strengthened the walls even more
i hope we can salvage a few memories
to carry us through the long night
the clock's striking midnight yesterday's gone
and there's no tomorrow in sight
[verse diana krall]
i could show the world how to smile
i could be glad all of the while
i could change the gray skies to blue
if I had you
i could leave the old days behind
leave all my pals I'd never mind
i could start my life at anew
if I had you
[chorus willie nelson & diana krall]
i could climb the snow-capped mountains
sail the mighty ocean wide
i could cross the burning desert
if I had you by my side
i could be a king uncrowned
humble or poor rich or renowned
there is nothing I couldn't do
if I had you
[instrumental break]
[chorus diana krall & willie nelson]

[outro diana krall & willie nelson]
there is nothing there is nothing I couldn't do
if I had you
i'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't go
and the first to say be happy if you can
but you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
do you mind too much if I don't understand
i suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
i guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
but do you mind too much if I don't understand
forgive me but it all seems so unreal to me
and my heart and me we'd made so many plans
but that's all over now there's nothing left to do
but do you mind too much if I don't understand
do you mind too much if I don't understand
don't know why there's no sun up in the sky stormy weather
since my gal and I ain't together keeps raining all the time
life is bare gloom and misery everywhere stormy weather
[verse 1]
just can't get my poor self together I'm weary all the time all the time
when she went away the blues walked in and met me
if she stays away old rocking chair will get me
all I do is pray the lord above will let me walk in the sun once more
am I blue am I blue
ain't these tears in these eyes telling you
am I blue well you'd be too
if your dreams and your schemes done fell through
there was a time I was your only one
but now I'm sad and lonely one I'm such lonely one
was I gay until today
now you're gone and we're through
am I blue
was I gay until today
now you're gone and we're through
am I blue
now you're gone and we're through
am I blue
[verse 1]
the silence is unusually loud tonight
the strange sound of nothing fills my ears
then night rushes in like a crowd of nights
and the ghost of our old love appears
[verse 2]
this strange world of darkness that comes with the night
grows darker when it walks my way
then it laughs while I listen for the breaking of day
and the ghost of our old love goes away
[instrumental break]

you called me country willie the night you walked away
with the one who promised you a life of joy
you thought my life too simple and yours was much too gay
to spend it living with a country boy
so I'm writing you this letter I write you every day
i hope that you've received the ones before
but I've heard not one word from you and every day I pray
that you will not forget your country boy
[verse 2]
while you're living in the city with riches around your door
is this your love is this your kind of joy
or do you find there's something missing does your heart cry out for more
and do you sometimes miss your country boy
[verse 3]
a cottage in the country with roses around the door
could not compete with flashing city lights
but it's all I have to offer except for one thing more
a heart so filled with love that it could die
well it's time to end this letter the light of dawn is near
a lonely night has passed but there'll be more
just one more thing in closing for all the world to hear
come home I love you signed your country boy
i'm drinking champagne feeling no pain till early morning
dining and dancing with every pretty girl I can find
and I'm having a fling with a pretty young thing till early morning
knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind
guilty conscience I guess though I must confess
i never loved you much when you were mine
so I'll keep drinking champagne
guilty conscience I guess
so I'll keep drinking champagne
knowing tomorrow I'll wake up with you on my mind

she's a railroad lady
just a little bit shady
spending her days on a train
she's the semi good looker
but the fast rails they took her
now she's trying just trying
to get home again
[verse 1]
south station in boston
to the stockyards of austin
from the florida sunshine
to the new orleans rain
now that the rail packs
have taken the best tracks
she's trying just trying
to get back home again
[chorus 1]
[verse 2]
once a high-balling loner
thought he could own her
and he bought her a fur coat
and a big diamond ring
but she hung in for cold cash
left down on the wabash
never thinking never thinking
of home way back then
but the rails are now rusty
and the dining car's dusty
the gold plated watches
are taking their gold
the railroads're dying
and the lady is crying
on a bus to kentucky
and home that's her goal
[chorus 1]
[verse 1]
well I met a california girl in memphis
and she tried to take me upstairs for a ride
and she had to hold me right across her shoulder
and I just can't seem to get her off of my mind
these honky tonk women
gonna give me give me give me the honky tonk blues
she's a honky tonk woman
give me give me give me the honky tonk blues
[verse 2]
well I later did the same in new york city
and I had to pull out of some kind of a fight
and the lady she covered me with roses
she blew my nose and then she blew my mind
these honky tonk women gonna
give me give me give me the honky tonk girls
well there's a honky tonk woman
give me give give me the honky tonk girl
[verse 3]
and she had to hold me right across her shoulder
i just can't seem to get her off of my mind
she's a honky tonk woman
give me give me the honky tonk girl
honky tonk women
give me give me the honky tonk girl
she's a honky tonk woman
if this is a game we play
and if this is a roll I play
where are the words I say to you
the words don't fit the picture anymore
and if we've been acting all along
and we both act right and we both act wrong
where does it say that we should cry
it's just the words don't fit the picture anymore anymore
the words don't fit the picture anymore
no need to force the love scenes anymore
and a one act play comes to an end
and we turn to leave we can both part friends
but this is the time to say goodbye goodbye
because the words don't fit the picture anymore anymore
[verse 1]
i threw my robe on in the morning
watched the ring on the stove turn red
stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee
pulled on my boots and made the bed
screen door hanging off its hinges
kept banging me awake all night
as I look out the window
the only thing in sight
[chorus 1]
is dry lightning on the horizon line
just dry lightning and you on my mind
[verse 2]
i chased the heat of her blood
like it was the holy grail
descend beautiful spirit
into the evening pale
her appaloosa's kicking
kicking in the corral smelling rain
there's a low thunder rolling
'cross the mesquite plain
[chorus 1]
[verse 3]
i'd drive down to alvarado street
where she'd dance to make ends meet
i'd spend the night over my gin
as she'd talk to her men
the piss yellow sun
comes bringing up the day
she said "ain't nobody can give nobody
what they really need anyway
well you get so sick of the fighting
you lose your fear of the end
but I can't lose your memory
and the sweet smell of your skin
[chorus 1]
[verse 1]
i meet her by the ocean layin' in the california sun
and she was some thing special like I never found in anyone
but living here in texas sure kept this ole boy on the moon
she said when I wasn't with her someone else would be pulling of her shoes
[verse 2]
that gal she hypnotized me and had me baying airline tickets every week
but every time I mention texas she moved a little further up the beach
then today she finally told me long distance love ain't working like before
and you don’t have a reason to come to california any more
i don’t have a reason to go to california anymore
and when she closed her heart she closed the california door
i might as well fall in the ocean
like I've heard it said a hundred times before
'cause I don’t have a reason to go to california anymore
i might as well fall in the ocean
like I've heard it said a hundred times before
'cause I don’t have a reason to go to california anymore
i don’t have a reason to go to california anymore
there are those who can leave love or take it
love to them is just what they make it
i wish that I were the same
but love is my favourite game
i fall in love too easily
i fall in love too fast
i fall in love too terribly hard
for love to ever last
my heart should be well-schooled
'cause I've been burned in the past
and still I fall in love too easily
i fall in love too fast
[verse 1]
hey baby don't you think I know
i've been acting real funny for a week or so
it's not like me to see things through
but I've never seen a sight quite like you
it's time for me to face the facts
i've gone too far and I can't turn back
i'm in love and it's all your fault
turned my head and my heart got caught
gone without a thought
i'm in love and its all your fault
[verse 2]
i've survived behind these walls
never thought that I could see them fall
hey now baby I can't believe
that I give in so easily
the look in your eyes the feel of your lips
the touch of your skin on my fingertips
turned my head and my heart got caught
gone without a thought
i'm in love and it's all your fault
[verse 1]
these lines in my face caused from worry
grow deeper as you walk out of sight
mine is the face of a fighter
but my heart has just lost the fight
[verse 2]
round one you told me you loved me
an' I felt my heart falling there an' then
the last round you walked tall an' left me
an' I guess my heart's losin' again
mine is the face of a fighter
i fought for your love with all my might
mine is the face of fighter
but my heart has just lost the fight
yes mine is the face of a fighter
i fought for your love with all my might
mine is the face of fighter
but my heart has just lost the fight
[verse 1]
well they tell me of a pie up in the sky
waiting for me when I die
but between the day you're born and when you die
they never seem to hear even your cry
because as sure as the sun will shine
i'm going to get my share now of what's mine
the harder they come the harder they'll fall
one and all
the harder they come the harder they'll fall
one and all
[verse 2]
well the oppressors are trying to keep me down
trying to drive me underground
and they think that they have got the battle won
i say forgive them lord they know not what they've done
[verse 3]
and I keep on fighting for the things I want
though I know that when you're dead you can't
but I'd rather be a free man in my grave
than living as a puppet or a slave
i'm falling in love again
never thought I would again
never I thought I would
and I may be making mistakes again
but if I lose or win
how will I know how will I know
how will I know how will I know
and I'm falling in love again
and if I lose or win
how will I know
you know dasher and dancer and prancer and vixen
comet and cupid and donner and blitzen
but do you recall the most famous reindeer of all
rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
"rudolph with your nose so bright
won't you guide my sleigh tonight"
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
"rudolph the red-nosed reindeer
you'll go down in history"

would you lay with me in a field of stone
if my needs were strong would you lay with me
should my lips grow dry would you wet them dear
in the midnight hour if my lips were dry
would you go away to another land walk a thousand miles through the burning sand
wipe the blood away from my dying hand if I give my love to you
will you bathe with me in the stream of life
when the moon is full will you bathe with me
will you love me when I am down and out
in my time of trials will you stand by me
would you go away to another land
now we all know the violin plays sweetly
and the steel guitar thrills all the world completely
but for all around good fun there's really only one
and it's round and firm and fully packed and puts the blues on the run
and you just can't play a sad song on the banjo
a banjo tune will have to make you smile
and when you're feeling low and melancholy
just pick up the old banjo by golly
because you just can't play a sad song on the banjo
now bad news just won't hang around the banjo
old dismal gloom will have to disappear
a sad song can't be played so please don't be afraid
[verse 1]
just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
susan and the plans they made put an end to you
walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
i just can't remember who to send it to
oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
but I always thought I'd see you again
[verse 2]
you got to look down upon me jesus you got help me make a stand
you just gotta see me through another day
my body is aching and my time is at hand I won't make it any other way
oh I've seen fire[]
[verse 3]
i've been working my mind through an easy time my back turned towards the sun
lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
and there's hours of time on the telephone lines to talk about the things to come
sweet dreams and flying machines and pieces on the ground
oh I've seen fire and I've seen rain
i've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
i've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
but I always thought I'd see you again
[verse 1]
i tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream
yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme
a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart
why can't I free your debtful mind and melt your cold cold heart
[verse 2]
another love before my time made your heart sad and blue
and so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do
in anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start
[verse 3]
you'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry
you know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try
why do you run and hide from life to try it just ain't smart
[verse 4]
there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me
but now I know your heart is shackled to a memory
the more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart
[verse 1]
shall we gather at the river
where bright angels he has brought
with it's crystal tides forever
flowing by the throne of god
yes we'll gather at the river
the beautiful the beautiful river
gather with the saints at the river
that flows by the throne of god
[verse 2]
on the margin of the river
washing up its silver spray
we will talk and worship ever
all the happy golden day
[verse 3]
ere we reach the shining river
lay we every burden down
praise our spirits will deliver
and provide our robe and crown
[verse 4]
soon we'll reach the shining river
soon our pilgrimage will cease
soon our happy hearts will quiver
with the melody of peace
i'll be seeing you
in all the old familiar places
that this heart of mine embraces
all day through
in that small cafe
the park across the way
the children's carousel
the chestnut trees
the wishing well
i'll be seeing you
in every lovely summer's day
in every thing that's light and gay
i'll always think of you that way
i'll find you
in the morning sun
and when the night is new
i'll be looking at the moon
but I'll be seeing you
[verse 1]
it's a lesson too late for the learning made of sand made of sand
and in the wink of an eye my soul is turning in your hand in your hand
are you going away with no word of farewell
and will there be not a trace left behind
i could have loved you better I didn't mean to be unkind
you know that was the last thing on my mind
[verse 2]
you got reasons of plenty for going this I know this I know
for the weeds have been steadily growing please don't go please don't go
are you going away
are you going away
let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time
i hope we'll see him up in fargo or somewhere farther down the line
this time he sure drew a bad one one that nobody could ride
by the way he pulled his hat on you know he'd be there for the fight
and it's the classic contradiction the unavoidable affliction
and it don't take much to predict son the way it always goes
because one day she'll say she loves you and the next she'll be tired of you
and push'll always come to shove you on that midnight rodeo
he almost made it to the buzzer somehow he gave up in the end
he put one hand around the other and let that pick up man on in
it was his last chance to ride it now he'll have to move along
but he knows back in his mind that he won't be away for long
and it's the classic contradiction
so let's have a hand for that young cowboy and wish him better luck next time
i hope we'll see him up in fargo or somewhere farther down the line
[verse 1]
i was born on a farm down in iowa
i pulled the tall corn and I worked in the hay
got caught by a girlie but she set me free
i heard the timber out in oregon calling me
hey won't you tell me mr lumberjack
is it one for forward and three for back
is it two for stop and four for go
boy ask the whistle punk I don't know
[verse 2]
i learned this fact from a logger named ray
you don't cut timber on a windy day
stay out of the woods when the moisture's low
or you ain't gonna live to collect your dough
hey won't you tell me mr lumberjack
is it one for forward and three for back
is it two for stop and four for go
boy ask the whistle punk I don't know
[verse 3]
well you work in the woods from morn 'til night
and you laugh and you sing and you cuss and you fight
and on saturday night you go to eugene
and on a sunday morning your pockets are clean
hey won't you tell me mr lumberjack
is it one for forward and three for back
is it two for stop and four for go
boy ask the whistle punk I don't know
[verse 4]
well you work in the winter in the rain and the sleet
and in the summer you darn near die from the heat
and at night you're so tired that you sleep in your socks
and you dream of paul bunyan and his big blue ox
hey won't you tell me mr lumberjack
is it one for forward and three for back
is it two for stop and four for go
boy ask the whistle punk I don't know
[verse 1]
everybody's gone away
said they're moving to la
there's not a soul I know around
everybody's leaving town
some caught a freight some caught a plane
find the sunshine leave the rain
they said this town will waste your time
i guess they're right it's wasting mine
some got to win some got to lose
good time charlie's got the blues
some got to win some got to lose
good time charlie's got the blues
[verse 2]
you know my heart keeps telling me
you're not a kid at thirty-three
you play around you lose your wife
you play too long you lose your life
i got my pills to ease the pain
can't find a thing to ease the rain
i'd love to try and settle down
but everybody's leaving town
some got to win some got to lose
good time charlie's got the blues
some got to win some got to lose
good time charlie's got the blues
those happy hours I spent with you
that lovely afterglow
most of all I miss you so
your sweet caresses each rendezvous
your voice so soft and and low
most of all I miss you so
you once filled my heart
no regrets no fears
now you'll find my heart
filled to the top with the tears
i'll always love you and want you too
how much you'll never know
most of all I miss you so
[verse 1]
o lord my god
when I in awesome wonder
consider all the worlds
they hands have made
i see the stars
i hear the rolling thunder
thy power throughout
the universe displayed
then sings my soul
my savior god to thee
how great thou art
how great thou art
then sings my soul
my savior god to thee
how great thou art
how great thou art
[verse 2]
when christ shall come
with shouts of acclamation
and take me home
what joy shall fill my heart
then I shall bow
in humble adoration
and there proclaim
[verse 1]
you're only in my arms to cry on my shoulder
over someone you're trying to forget
you're wearing a smile but it's just a disguise
i know your heart is breakin' 'cause there's tears in your eyes
[verse 2]
so have your little cry and when it's all over
you'll just say goodbye and part
'cause you're only in my arms to cry on my shoulder
and you're crying your way into my heart
[verse 1]
you're only in my arms to cry on my shoulder
over someone you're trying to forget
you're wearing a smile but it's just a disguise
i know your heart is breakin' 'cause there's tears in your eyes
[verse 2]
so have your little cry and when it's all over
you'll just say goodbye and part
'cause you're only in my arms to cry on my shoulder
and you're crying your way into my heart
and you're crying your way into my heart
a bright array of city lights as far as I can see
the great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me
the cabarets and honky tonks their flashing signs invite
a broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights
lights that say forget her name in a glass of cherry wine
lights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine
they paint a pretty picture of a world that's gay and bright
but it's just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights
the world was dark and god made stars to brighten up the night
the god who put the stars above I don't believe made those lights
oh it's just a place for men to cry when things don't turn out right
just a place to run away and hide behind those city lights
lights that say forget her love in a different atmosphere
lights that lure are nothing but a masquerade for tears
they paint a pretty picture but my arms can't hold them tight
and I just can't say I love you to a street of city lights
[verse 1]
i've cried so much lately
that I've made out of list
the things to remember
things to forget
but my mind can't separate
joy from regret
i always remember the things
to forget
[chorus 1]
things to remember
with the day that we met
the day that we parted
things to forget
[chorus 2]
well why won't my heart
let me do it this way
with just things to remember
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
[verse 1]
i can hear the wind a blowing in my mind
just the way it used to sound through the georgia pines
and you were there to answer when I called you and me we had it all
[verse 2]
remember how I used to touch your hair
while reaching for the feeling that was always there
and you were there to answer when I called you and me we had it all
[verse 3]
i know that we can never live those times again
so I let my dreams take me back to where we have been
then I'll stay with you girl as long as I can
oh it was so good oh it was so good oh it was so good when I was your man
i'll never stop believing in your smile
even though you didn't stay it was all worth while
and you were there to answer when I called you and me we had it all
[verse 1]
i'm so tired of all this trouble now aren't you
we've tried and failed to make our dreams come true
it seems that we had dream worlds all our own
so don't you think that we should try it once alone
[verse 2]
life's too short to spend it feeling blue
and it's not too late our dreams could still come true
but before our chance for happiness is gone
don't you think that we should try it once alone
[verse 3]
it's not your fault and neither is it mine
it seems that we're just victims of the times
it's not that I don't love you 'cause I do
but love alone can't make a dream come true
[verse 4]
i suppose that we'll survive the parting tears
we've survived so many others through the years
but before our chance for happiness is gone
don't you think that we should try it once alone
[verse 1]
who do I know in dallas who can I call on the phone
who do I know in dallas that will help me forget she's gone
shirley consoled me in phoenix and jeannie in old san antone
but who do I know in dallas that will help me forget that I'm alone
[verse 2]
i can't spend the night without someone the lonelies will drive me insane
so who do I know in dallas that will make me be happy I came
who do I know in dallas that will make me be happy I came
she thinks if she just holds on he will get it back together
on his good days he's a good man and he fills up all her dreams
on his bad days he's the devil and it's hell to stand beside him
but she thinks if she will love him life will be what once it seemed
women who love too much burning fires they have to touch
give until there's nothing left to give use up life to help men live
women who love too much just can't leave the dark alone
fall in love with the unknown they will go until they're gone
he knows he loves too little and he takes her in his knowing
on the bad days when he needs her she's the best hope that he's had
and he knows that he's the weak one and he doesn't want to know it
and he holds on to her loving though he knows it's all so sad
women who love too much
women who love too much
mona lisa mona lisa men have named you
you're so like the lady with the mystic smile
is it only because you're lonely they have blamed you
for that mona lisa strangeness in your smile
do you smile to tempt a lover mona lisa
or is this your way to hide a broken heart
many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
they just lie there and they die there
are you warm are you real mona lisa
or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
do you smile to tempt a lover mona lisa
or is this your way to hide a broken heart
many dreams have been brought to your doorstep
they just lie there and they die there
are you warm are you real mona lisa
or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
mona lisa mona lisa
i walk up to my door and hate to turn the key
emptiness is all that waits inside for me
that's how it is when the one you love is gone
that's how it is when your house is not a home
i look around and see things marked with his and hers
little things like this just make things that much worse
that's how it is ask anyone who lives alone
that's how it is when your house is not a home
is there a way out on a heart as torn as mine
each day I live I'm like a prisoner passing time
that's how it is when the one you love is gone
that's how it is when your house is not a home
that's how it is when your house is not a home
commandancy of the alamo san antonio february 24th 1836
to the people of texas and all the americans in the world fellow citizens and compatriots I am besieged with a thousand or more of the mexicans under santa anna and I have sustained a continual bombardment and cannonade for twenty-four hours and have not lost a man the enemy has demanded a surrender of discretion
otherwise the garrison are to be put to the sword if the fort is taken I have answered the demand with a cannon shot and our flag still waves proudly from the walls I shall never surrender or retreat then I call on you in the name of liberty and of patriotism and of everything dear to the american character to come to our aide with all dispatch the enemy is receiving reinforcements daily and will no doubt increase to three or four thousand in four or five days if this call is neglected I am determined to sustain as long as possible and die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his own honor and that of his country​ victory or death
william barrett travis lieutenant colonel commandant
ps​ the lord is on our side when the enemy appeared in sight we had not three bushels of corn we have since found in deserted houses eighty or ninety bushels and got into the walls twenty or thirty head of beeves​
[verse 1]
when the trumpet of the lord shall sound and time shall be no more
and the morning breaks eternal bright and fair
when the saved of earth shall gather over on the other shore
and the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
when the roll is called up yon-der[x3]
when the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
[verse 2]
on that bright and cloudless morning when the dead in christ shall rise
and the glory of his resurrection share
when his chosen ones shall gather to their home beyond the skies
and the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
[verse 3]
let us labor for the master from the dawn till setting sun
let us talk of all his wondrous love and care
then when all of life is over and our work on earth is done
and the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
in a quaint caravan
there's a lady they call the gypsy
she can look in the future
and drive away all your fears
everything will come right
if you'll only believe the gypsy
she could tell at a glance
that my heart was so full of tears
she looked at my hand and told me
my lover was always true
and yet in my heart I knew dear
somebody else was kissing you
but I'll go there again
'cause I want to believe the gypsy
that my lover is true
and will come back to me someday
she looked at my hand and told me
my lover was always true
and yet in my heart I knew dear
somebody else was kissing you
but I'll go there again
'cause I want to believe the gypsy
that my lover is true
and will come back to me someday
[verse 1]
the seasons come the seasons go
we get a little sunshine rain and snow
just the way that it was planned to be
but there's no seasons in my heart
while you play the leading part
because the flowers will bloom eternally
your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
and my tears like withered leaves will fall
but spring it could bring some glad tomorrow
and darling we could be happy after all
[verse 2]
as it all is in natures plan
no season gets the upper hand oh
how I tried to keep this fact in mind
the trees are bare the cold wind blows
and by experience I know
that winter comes but the spring is close behind
your leaving will bring autumn sorrow
and my tears like withered leaves will fall
but spring it could bring some glad tomorrow
and darling we could be happy after all
[verse 1]
today I started loving you again
and I'm right back where I've really always been
i got over you just long enough to let my heartaches mend
and then today I started loving you again
[verse 2]
what a fool I was to think I could get by
with only these few teardrops that I've cried
i should have known the worst was yet to come
and that crying time for me had just begun
and today I started loving you again
today I started loving you again
the odds were a hundred to one against me
the world thought the heights were too high to climb
but people from missouri never incensed me
oh I wasn’t a bit concerned
for from hist’ry I had learned
how many many times the worm had turned
they all laughed at christopher columbus
when he said the world was round
they all laughed when edison recorded sound
they all laughed at wilbur and his brother
when they said that man could fly
they told marconi
wireless was a phony
it’s the same old cry
they laughed at me wanting you
said I was reaching for the moon
but oh you came through
now they’ll have to change their tune
they all said we never could be happy
they laughed at us and how
but ho ho ho
who’s got the last laugh now
they all laughed at rockefeller center
now they’re fighting to get in
they all laughed at whitney and his cotton gin
they all laughed at fulton and his steamboat
hershey and his chocolate bar
ford and his misery
kept the laughers busy
that’s how people are
they laughed at me wanting you
said it would be "hello goodbye"
but oh you came through
now they’re eating humble pie
they all said we’d never get together
darling let’s take a bow
for ho ho ho
who’s got the last laugh
he hee hee
let’s at the past laugh
ha ha ha
who’s got the last laugh now
[verse 1]
i'm making believe that you still love me
and it's leaving me alone and so blue
i'll always dream but I'll never own you
i'll keep loving you and making believe
[verse 2]
i can't hold you close darling when you're not with me
you're somebody's love now and you'll never be mine
but I'll always dream but I'll never own you
i'll keep loving you and making believe
[instrumental break]
[verse 1]
i'm making believe that you still love me
and it's leaving me alone and so blue
i'll always dream but I'll never own you
i'll keep loving you and making believe
[verse 2]
i can't hold you close darling when you're not with me
you're somebody's love now and you'll never be mine
but I'll always dream but I'll never own you
i'll keep loving you and making believe
i told my heart I didn't love you that I'd be happy if we'd part
but now I know I was mistaken I told a lie to my heart
i told my heart I didn't love you now we'll forever be apart
lonely years of tears and sorrow I told a lie to my heart
if we sin somehow we pay and now the bitter teardrops start
i must learn to live without you I told a lie to my heart
i told my heart I didn't love you that I'll be happy if we'll part
lonely years of tears and sorrow I told a lie to my heart
[verse 1]
i'm so ashamed of my eyes 'cause they still cry for you
after they both watched my hand wave goodbye to you
i've told them time and time again that this will never do
and I've told them how you always laughed at teardrops
[verse 2]
i'm so ashamed of my arms for missing you
last night I woke up just in time to see them reach for you
and now my heart confesses it still wants you too
i'm so ashamed of them all for loving you
and now my heart confesses it still wants you too
i'm so ashamed of them all for loving you
[verse 1]
try to think that love's not around
but it's uncomfortably near
my poor heart ain't gaining no ground
'cause my angel eyes ain't here
[verse 2]
angel eyes that old devil's scent
they glow unbearably bright
need I say my love is misspent
on angel eyes tonight
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
have fun you happy people
the laughs and the jokes are on me
pardon me but I gotta run
the fact's uncommonly clear
i got to find who's now number one
and why my angel eyes ain't here
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
have fun you happy people
the laughs and the jokes are on me
pardon me but I gotta run
the fact's uncommonly clear
i got to find who's now number one
and why my angel eyes ain't here
excuse me while I disappear
[verse 1]
the dance is over now
as the melody just echoes in the night
of the love song that I sang out of tune
to a drummer out of time
i tripped the light fantastic
and never hearing harmonies were lost
and now I sit alone in the silence
looking at the cost
'cause the piper came today
and he was hell to pay
'cause he took my world away
when the piper came today
[verse 2]
in the shadows of the dim light
as the piper plays the cheaters hide
never giving thought
to the cost of the never-ending lies
and the sweater played his music
the more is added to the bitter price
for the dance is over now
and the melody just echoes in the night
'cause the piper came today
and he was hell to pay
'cause he took my world away
when the piper came today
'cause he took my world away
when the piper came today
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
well it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
woman shined the apple and the man had to take a bite
anything that good god knows just had to be right
well they woke up naked with a bit headache
he been done in by a slippery snake
a man and a woman get to live a while and then they die
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
politicians make promises that they can’t keep
they keep printin’ money ‘till they get in way too deep
it’s the same old lesson they never learn
they’re too busy workin’ on their next term
politicians keep makin’ fools out of you and me
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
money breeds war as long as there’s a man alive
rich kids go to college and the poor kids fight
high-rollers crap out every time roll a soldier’s bones like loaded dice
war is the beast that makes every mother cry
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
he told the truth and they hung him up to die
the son of god who created you and i
he said it in the good book and letters in red
but we keep on forgettin’ every thing he said
jesus christ hung on the cross for you and i
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
it’s been that way since the git go
lord it’s always been that way
lonely nights I cannot sleep I just lie awake and weep
wondering if I'll get a chance to make things right
don't you have a heart at all can't you see my teardrops fall
they are tears I shed for you these lonely nights
won't you reconsider this you're the one dear that I miss
won't you come back here and say that you'll be mine
we could be so happy then I would love you 'til no end
there would be no broken hearts or lonely nights
lonely nights I cannot sleep I just lie awake and weep
wondering if I'll get a chance to make things right
don't you have a heart at all can't you see my teardrops fall
they are tears I shed for you these lonely nights
[instrumental break]
won't you reconsider this you're the one dear that I miss

lonely nights I cannot sleep I just lie awake and weep
wondering if I'll get a chance to make things right

they are tears I shed for you these lonely nights
[verse 1]
i come to the garden alone
while the dew is still on the roses
and the voice I hear falling on my ear
the son of god discloses
and he walks with me
and he talks with me
and he tells me I am his own
and the joy we share as we tarry there
none other has ever known
[verse 2]
he speaks and the sound of his voice
is so sweet the birds hush their singing
and the melody that he gave to me
within my heart is ringing
i'd stay in the garden with him
though the night around me be falling
but he bids me go through the voice of woe
his voice to me is calling
take me in your arms and hold me
like I've been holding you in my heart
take me in your arms and tell me
that you've missed me since we've been apart
you just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
and take me in your arms and hold me
like I've been holding you in my heart
you just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
and take me in your arms and hold me
like I've been holding you in my heart
you just don't know how heartsick and lonesome I've been
or how much I've prayed that you'll come back again
and take me in your arms and hold me
like I've been holding you in my heart
[verse 1]
you can't break your eggs to count your chickens
and you can't break your neck to keep your ducks all in a row
but don't think every chance you take has to mean a new mistake
it ain't necessarily so
now depending on the soil and the season
you can plant a seed and you can watch it grow
but you can't have a guarantee because everything that ought to be
ain't necessarily so
i laugh when I can and I live with the rest
i learned that holding on means letting go
i try to be a friend to the person on my left
they say you just can't be too careful who you know
but that ain't necessarily so
[verse 2]
i'd like to have more faith in human logic
basing all the rules on the proof that you can show
but I can't take my guesses back that I based on all those facts
that ain't necessarily so
and every time I follow what I'm feeling
i end up in the same place my heart would have me go
if there's one rule of life I trust it's everything outside your gut
ain't necessarily so
i laugh when I can and I live with the rest
i learned that holding on means letting go
i try to be a friend to the person on my left
they say you just can't be too careful who you know
but that ain't necessarily so
i laugh when I can and I live with the rest
i learned that holding on means letting go
i try to be a friend to the person on my left
they say you just can't be too careful who you know
but that ain't necessarily so
[verse 1]
way down in louisiana
among the tall grown sugar canes
lived a simple man and a dominicker hen
and a rose of a different name
the first time I fell lightly
i was standing in the drizzling rain
with a trembling hand and a bottle of gin
and a rose of a different name
the devil made me do it the first time
the second time I did it on my own
lord put a handle on a simple handed man
and help me leave that black rose alone
[verse 2]
when the devil made that woman
lord he threw the pattern away
well she were built for speed with the tools you need
to make a new fool every day
way down deep and dirty
on the darker side of shame
you'll find this cain-raising man doing it again
with a rose of a different name
the devil made me do it the first time
the second time I did it on my own
lord put a handle on a simple handed man
and help me leave that black rose alone
the devil made me do it the first time
the second time I did it on my own
lord put a handle on a simple handed man
and help me leave that black rose alone

she's out of my life she's out of my life
and I don't know whether to laugh or cry
i don't know whether to live or die
and it cuts like a knife she's out of my life
it's out of my hands it's out of my hands
to think for two years she was here
and I took her for granted I was so cavalier
now the way that it stands she's out of my hands
i have learned love is not possession
and I have learned that love won't wait
i have learned love needs expression
but I learned it too late
she's out of my life she's out of my life
and I don't know whether to laugh or cry
i don't know whether to live or die
and it cuts like a knife she's out of my life
[verse 1]
within my prison cell so dreary
i sit alone with aching heart
i'm dreamin' of my little darling
from her forever I must part
[verse 2]
the rose she sent me as a token
she sent it just to light my gloom
and tell me that her heart is broken
and cheer me before I meet my doom
[verse 3]
the judge would not believe my story
the jury said I have to pay
and with the rose in all its glory
not guilty was all that I could say
[verse 4]
goodbye sweetheart for in the morning
to meet my maker I must go
and when I die at daylight's dawning
against my heart they'll find this rose
within my prison cell so dreary
[verse 1]
last evening I turned by the pages of time
and tore out the chapters when you were mine
i attempted to cut out the memories of you
and paste in some new ones far better and true
[verse 2]
i searched through the chapters referring to hearts
for the one with the caption "'til death do us part"
i ripped at each letter and I tore at each word
i screamed at your memory and nobody heard
nobody heard
[verse 3]
but your memory's determined and chances are few
of my ever finding a replacement for you
it desperately clings to the floor of my mind
and fights for its place in the pages of time
one has my name and the other has my heart
with one I'll remain
that's when my heartaches start
one has brown eyes and the other's eyes're blue
to one I am tied
to the other I am true
one has my love and the other only me
but what good is love
to a heart that can't be free
so I'll go on living
my life's just the same
while one has my heart and the other has my name
[steel - guitar]
[verse 1]
they said that my heart wouldn't have long to live
to lose you was more than it could stand
and that your love was all that could make it survive
but I'm doing all that I can
i just feed it a memory to keep it alive
a taste of the love that we once knew
and when my heartbeat gets weak and it's starting to die
i just feed it a memory of you
[verse 2]
i must keep my heart living someway and somehow
in case that you might change your mind
so if you can give it the love that it needs
just come by and see it sometime
and feed it a memory to help keep it alive
a taste of the love that we once knew
and when my heartbeat gets weak and when it's starting to die
i just feed it a memory of you
[verse 1]
out where the bright lights are glowing
you're drawn like a moth to a flame
you laugh while the wine's overflowing
while I sit and whisper your name
four walls to hear me
four walls to see
four walls too near me
closing in on me
[verse 2]
sometimes I ask why I'm waiting
but my walls have nothing to say
i'm made for love not for hating
so here where you left I stay
[verse 3]
one night with you is like heaven
and so while I'm walking the floor
i listen for steps in the hallway
and wait for your knock on my door
[verse 1]
why do you treat me as if I were only a friend
what have I done that has made you so distant and cold
sometimes I wonder if you'll be contented again
will you be happy when you are withered and old
[verse 2]
i cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so fine
i cannot offer you all the clothes that your young body craves
but if you'll say that you long to forever be mine
just think of the teardrops the heartaches and sorrow you'll save
[verse 3]
while I am writing this letter I think of the past
and of the promises that you have broken so free
and to this old world I'll soon say my farewell at last
i will be gone when you read this last letter from me
i saw the harbor lights
they only told me we were parting
the same old harbor lights that once broughts you to me
i watched the harbor lights
how could I help if tears were starting
goodbye to tender nights beside the silvery sea
i longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more
but you were on the ship and I was on the shore
now I know lonely nights
for all the while my heart is whispering
some other harbor lights
will steal your love from me
i longed to hold you near and kiss you just once more
but you were on the ship and I was on the shore
now I know lonely nights
for all the while my heart is whispering
some other harbor lights
will steal your love from me
there ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
[verse 1]
never have seen a river that's too wide
[verse 2]
there ain't no rope stout enough to bind me
look for me honey you will find me
any old time get ready with your charm
i'll be there ready and a-waiting
there won't be any hesitating
i'll be there if you ever want me in your arms
love me if you're ever going to love me
never have seen a road too rough to ride
[verse 1]
i lost my mind so long ago
i wanted everyone to know
i wanted everyone to see
my broken heart belong to me
i go beyond the thought of you
and a broken heart was nothing new
i wanted everyone to see
my broken heart belong to me
and now as autumn fills the air
i feel your spirit everywhere
and now my fears are coming true
my broken heart belongs to you
and now my fears are coming true
my broken heart belongs to you
when you pack your clothes tonight don't pack up all the blame
you're not the first to walk away and leave someone in pain
i know how much it's hurting you hurting me this way
believe me I've been in your shoes and I know you can't stay
i've been on both sides of goodbye
and I know there ain't no easy side
i've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time
i've been on both sides of goodbye
don't feel so bad for doing what you have to do
you can't make your heart love me if it doesn't want to
when love doesn't go both ways and someone's got to go
so close that door and don't look back believe me I know
i've been on both sides of goodbye
and I know there ain't no easy side
i've loved and I've been loved but not at the same time
i've been on both sides of goodbye
once in a while will you try to give one little thought to me
though someone else maybe nearer your heart
once in a while will you dream of the moments I shared with you
moments before we two drifted apart
in love's smoldering ember one spark may remain
if love still can remember the spark may burn again
i know that I'll be contented with yesterday's memory
knowing you think of me once in a while
in love's smoldering ember one spark may remain
if love still can remember the spark may burn again
i know that I'll be contented with yesterday's memory
knowing you think of me once in a while
knowing you think of me once in a while
all the years combine they melt into a dream
a broken angel sings from a guitar
in the end there's just a song comes cryin' up the night
thru all the broken dreams and vanished years
stella blue stella blue
when all the cards are down there's nothing left to see
there's just the pavement left and broken dreams
in the end there's still that song comes cryin' like the wind
down every lonely street that's ever been
stella blue stella blue
i've stayed in every blue-light cheap hotel can't win for trying
dust off those rusty strings just one more time
gonna make them shine shine
it all rolls into one and nothing comes for free
there's nothing you can hold for very long
and when you hear that song come crying like the wind
it seems like all this life was just a dream
stella blue stella blue
a thousand miles dear a thousand more across the water across the shore
i'll say a prayer dear for yours and mine please think of me dear each night at nine
i hold your picture close to my heart it takes your place dear while we're apart
helps remind me that you're still mine to feel your nearness night at nine
the bugle's playing out go the lights even it's lonely these army nights
go tell kids I'm doing fine give them my love dear each night at nine
a thousand miles dear
i'll say a prayer dear for yours and mine please think of me dear each night at nine
a one two three two two three
i let love die broke a woman's heart
have only myself to blame
fate ran its course I suffered a loss
i learned a lesson in pain
i cheated and lied I took love for granted
acting as cold as ice
but it's all in the past
i won't make the same mistake twice
once is enough
it's one time too many
change is rough
ooo once is enough
love went through such a sudden change
takin' a turn for the worst
joy turned to fear the pain got so severe

ooo and I paid the price
i lost love so fast
i won't make the same mistake twice

milk cow blues
is the better part over
has a raging river turned into a stream
is the better part over
are we down to not quite saying what we mean
and after thinking it over
wouldn't you rather have the ending nice and clean
where love remains in all the closing scenes
if the better part's over
why hang around
for an ending that's laden with sorrow
we've both been around
we've both seen that movie before
and as much as I love you
i can't live while fearing tomorrow
if the better part's over
then why should we try anymore
is the better part over
has a raging river turned into a stream
is the better part over
are we down to not quite saying what we mean
and after thinking it over
wouldn't you rather have the ending nice and clean
where love remains in all the closing scenes
is the better part over
[verse 1]
well I've got to run to keep from hidin'
and I'm bound to keep on ridin'
and I've got one more silver dollar
but I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[verse 2]
and I don't own the clothes I'm wearing
and the road goes on forever
and I've got one more silver dollar
but I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[verse 3]
and I've gone by the point of caring
some old bed I'll soon be sharing
and I've got one more silver dollar
but I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
[outro] [x3]
no I'm not gonna let 'em catch me no
not gonna let 'em catch the midnight rider
they all sat around in a circle laughing and all telling lies
then the tall one he bumped in a dollar he said boys I've got nothing to hide
the king and the queen stood together then the ace he would not be to blame
and if the cards were all laid on the table then love could be more than a game
and if the stars didn't shine on the water then the sun wouldn't burn on the sand
and if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am
and I have seen my share of long nights and I have told my share of lies
and I have run into the darkness when I saw the look in your eyes
but if the night didn't lie in the darkness then the daylight would be hard to find
and if the truth didn't turn to a weakness I would have never have spoken my mind
and if the stars didn't shine on the water
so if you're going out to carolina then don't linger in new mexico
and if you think of the one there behind you then you might not feel so alone
and if the stars didn't shine on the water
and if I were the man you wanted I would not be the man that I am
oh wondering minstrel man singing songs of strife
how many times have you been busted for showing signs of life
oh singing minstrel man sometimes you get the blues
when people try to stop you from singing your songs of truth
and you sing that you're tired of seeing your brother killing one another
and that silver in the hall but that's no silver in the dove
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
oh singing minstrel man trying to do your part
telling everyone that they're blind till they can see with their hearts
oh wondring minstrel man you get your clothes from good will
and your soul will never be owned by a worthless dollar bill
and you sing that you're tired of seeing your brother killing one another
and the silver in the hall but that's no silver in the dove
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love
nobody wants to hear your songs of love

president coolidge came down in a railroad train
with a little fat man with a note-pad in his hand
the president say "little fat man isn't it a shame
what the river has done
to this poor crackers land
[verse 1]
people steal they cheat and lie
for wealth and what it will buy
don't they know on the judgement day
that their gold and silver will melt away
i'd rather be in a deep dark grave
and know that my poor soul was saved
than to live in this world in a house of gold
and deny my god and doom my soul
jesus said come on to me
i'll break sin's chains and set you free
i'll carry you to a home on high
where you'll never never die
what good is gold and silver too
when your heart's not good and true
sinner hear me when I say
fall down on your knees and pray
[verse 2]
jesus died there on the cross
so this world would not be lost
sinner hear now what I say
for someday you'll have to pay
the sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue
the iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true
two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
[chorus 1][x2]
why oh why should love ever come
to couples like you and me
whose cold cold wars are never won
and whose hearts just can't be free
so let's do right or let's just say we're through
i just can't stand another cold cold war with you
[verse 1]
i couldn't sleep last night just walked the floor
don't know how I stand this anymore
lonely are the times since I lost you
received your invitation to the blues
i don't know why you caused me such pain
i just hope I'll never go through this much again
thanks for sending something I can't use
received your invitation to the blues
[verse 2]
you took the laughter from this world of mine
thanks to you the sun will never shine
walk the floor so much wore out my shoes
received your invitation to the blues
i don't know why you caused me such pain
i just hope I'll never go through this much again
lonely me I don't know what to do
received your invitation to the blues
nobody's fault but mine

if I leave my love behind
nobody's fault but mine
loves my sugar in my tea
loves my sugar in my tea
if I leave my love behind
nobody's fault but mine
[verse 2]
love will cry when I leave
love will cry when I leave
if I leave my love behind
nobody's fault but mine
[verse 1]
if you can truthfully say
that you've been true just one day
well that makes one in a row
one in a row one in a row
[verse 2]
and if you can look into my eyes
one time without telling lies
well that makes one in a row
one in a row one in a row
why do I keep loving you
after all the things you do
[verse 3]
and just one time come into my arms
and be glad that you're in my arms
that will make one in a row
one in a row one in a row
why do I keep loving you
after all the things you do
[verse 3]
and just one time come into my arms
and be glad that you're in my arms
that will make one in a row
one in a row one in a row
one in a row one in a row
[verse 1]
i've been trying so hard to forget you
but this chore of forgetting I find
has me burning both ends of the candle
and fighting a battle with time
[verse 2]
what I'd give just to sleep for a moment
but it's a luxury that I can't afford
for I know that I just dream about you
and my tears would start falling once more
so I'm burning both ends of the candle
i just hope that it lasts through the night
for each moment the candle is burning
brings closer the ending of life
so I'm burning both ends of the candle
i just hope that it lasts through the night
for each moment the candle is burning
it brings closer the ending of life
i know that I surprised you coming home
it's not my usual time of year
but I've got myself a problem
and I know that I might find the answer here
remember when I was dad's pride and joy and your little man
every time that I got hurt you were there to give a hand
you would pick me up and you'd kiss my hurt away
remember what you'd say
boy you're getting more like him each and everyday
can we have a talk like it was yesterday
your boy's back in trouble and he needs you right away
she said she's going to leave me momma
nothing on god's green earth will make her stay
i can't live without her momma
but this time you can't kiss the hurt away
but if I'm so much like my dad
there must've been times you felt her way
so tell me word for word what he said
that always made you stay
she said she's going to leave me momma
[verse 1]
oh since my baby left me I've found new place to dwell
down at the end on lonely street at heartbreak hotel
i get so lonely baby I get so lonely baby I get so lonely I could die
[verse 2]
and though it's always crowded you can still find some room
for broken hearted lovers to cry away the gloom
[verse 3]
well the bellhop's tears keep flowing the deskclerk's dressed in black
they've been so long on lonely street they'll never never never get back
[verse 4]
so if your baby leaves and you got a tale to tell
just take a walk down lonely street to heartbreak hotel
[verse 1]
i'll walk alone where once we wandered
it seems so strange since you are gone
'til you return I'll stay the same dear
i'll still be true and walk alone
[verse 2]
by stars above I swear to love you
with all the love I've ever known
while we're apart I'll stay the same dear
and when teardrops start I'll walk alone
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
the flame of love is brightly burning
and you know that I'm your very own
each night I pray for your returning
but while you're gone I'll walk alone
why me lord what I have ever done to deserve even one
of the pleasures I've known
tell me lord what did I ever do that was worth loving you
or the kindness you've shown
lord help me jesus I've wasted it so help me jesus I know what
i am
now that I know that I've needed you so help me jesus my soul's in your hand
try me lord if you think there's a way I can try to repay
all I've taken from you
maybe lord I can show someone else what I've been through myself
on my way back to you
lord help me jesus[]
jesus my soul's in your hand
[verse 1]
she said "if I ever deceived her
she'd be gone before I could count ten"
well I guess that I didn't believe her
because look at the trouble I'm in
she's gone gone gone gone gone gone
crying won't bring her back
the more that I cry the faster the train flies
further on down the track
[verse 2]
i lost every right to be happy
when I lost the heaven I'd found
she warned me she'd leave and she left me before
before my first tear hit the ground
she's gone gone gone gone gone gone
crying won't bring her back
the more that I cry the faster the train flies
further on down the track
[verse 3]
and if I only knew where to find her
i'd crawl back on my hands and knees
each tick of the clock's a reminder
she's one second further from me
she's gone gone gone gone gone gone
crying won't bring her back
the more that I cry the faster the train flies
further on down the track
silent night holy night
all is calm all is bright
round yon virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace
silent night holy night
shepherds quake at the sight
glories stream from heaven afar
heavenly hosts sing hallelujah
christ the savior is born
christ the savior is born
sleep in heavenly peace
these are difficult times
these are difficult times
lord please give me a sign
for these are difficult times
remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
don't waste a moment unhappy
invaluable moments gone with the leakage of time
as we leave on our own separate journeys
moving west with the sun to a place buried deep within our minds
and remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
remember the good times
they're smaller in number and easier to recall
don't spend too much time on the bad times
their staggering number will be heavy as lead on your mind
[verse 1]
haven't got a worry haven't got a care
gaven't got a thing to call my own
though I'm out of money and I'm a millionaire
i still have my home in san antone
[verse 2]
when I greet my neighbor with a hi you all
i'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
but when I feel like bragging I just up and say
i'm a native son of san antone
[instrumental break]
wade play
[verse 3]
well I travel around the country on my merry way
been to crowds and felt I was alone
but when I feel like bragging I just up and say
i'm a native son of san antone
[verse 4]
there's a sweet somebody by the alamo
someday she's gonna be my very own
and we'll buy a high chair in a year or so
for our little home in san antone
for our little home in san antone
for our little home in san antone
for our little home in san antone
[verse 1]
i'll be around no matter how you treat me now
i'll be around from now on
your latest love can never last and when it's past
i'll be around when he's gone
[verse 2]
goodbye again and if you find a love like mine
just now and [] drop a line to say "you're feelin' fine"
and when things go wrong perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
so I'll be around when he's gone
drop a line to say "you're feelin' fine"
and when things go wrong perhaps you'll see you're meant for me
so I'll be around when he's gone
when he's gone
when he's gone
[verse 1]
didn't sleep a wink last night
'cause you walked out the night before
just been sitting here rotting hoping you'd come knocking
knocking at my door
watched the moon pass by my window
the stars faded out of sight
the sun came into view and still I thought of you
and I didn't sleep a wink last night
[verse 2]
trying to remember what I'd done
to make you treat me so
what have I been guilty of
well I'd just like to know
thought if we could talk it over
maybe I could make things right
'cause until I'm forgiven I'm existing I'm not living
the sun came into view and still I thought of you
and I didn't sleep a wink last night
[verse 1]
now I lay me down to sleep and if I sleep perhaps I'll dream
and if I dream I'll be with you in the shelter of your arms
i pray that god will lengthen night and grant me time before the light
for the light of day will take me from the shelter of your arms
and though I know it's just a dream a dream that soon must end
the arms I feel I know are real and I'm happy once again
and if I die while I am asleep I pray my dreams he'll let me keep
and carry me through eternity in the shelter of your arms
and though I know it's just a dream a dream that soon must end
the arms I feel I know are real and I'm happy once again
and if I die while I am asleep I pray my dreams he'll let me keep
and carry me through eternity in the shelter of your arms
my hat don't hang on the same nail too long
my ears can't stand to hear the same old song
i don't leave the highway long enough
to bog down in the mud
i've got ramblin' fever in my blood
caught this ramblin' fever long ago
when I first heard a lonesome whistle blow
if someone said I ever gave a damn
man they damn sure told you wrong
i've had ramblin' fever all along
ramblin' fever
the kind that can't be measured by degrees
ramblin' fever
there ain't no kind of cure for my disease
there's times that I'd like to bed down on a sofa
and let some pretty lady rub my back
and spend the early mornin' drinkin' coffee
talkin' about when I'll be comin' back
but I don't let no no woman tie me down
and I never get too old to get around
i want to die along the highway and rot away
like some old high-line pole
rest this ramblin' fever in my soul
ramblin' fever
the kind that can't be measured by degrees
ramblin' fever
there ain't no kind of cure for my disease
ramblin' fever
ramblin' fever
[verse 1]
this face is all I have worn and lived in
and lines below my eyes are like old friends
and this old hearts' been beaten up
and my ragged soul has had things rough
and this face is all I have worn and lived in
the fairest they can fall bored in believing
something to achieve this peaceful feeling
after all these tears are only true
and your silver spoons can't dig up my roots
and this face is all I have worn and lived in
worn and lived in
through the tides of time
worn and lived in
this face of mine
and I kept believing the reflection on the wall
who needs to be the fairest of them all
[verse 2]
i never looked like you cool and streamlined
i have this honesty that grows with time
and when cracks appear they suit me fine
like a good old dog you won't hear me whine
and this face is all I have worn and lived in
[verse 3]
sins and lies they take the place of truth and answers
you can trade a glance and call it second sight
you can't buy sympathetic mirrors
and honesty is an answer you can't find
and I kept believing the reflection on the wall
who needs to be the fairest of them all
[verse 1]
well today there's no salvation the band's packed up and gone
left me standin' with a penny in my hand
there's a big crowd at the station where a blind man sings his songs
and he can see what I can't understand
it's the thirty-third of august and I'm finally touching down
eight days from sunday lord I'm saturday-bound
[verse 2]
once I stumble through the darkness tumble to my knees
a thousand voices screaming through my brain
woke up in the squad car busted down for vagrancy
and outside my cell sure as hell it looked like rain
it's the thirty-third of august and I'm finally touching down
eight days from sunday lord I'm saturday-bound
[verse 3]
now I put my angry feeling under lock and chain
i hide my violent nature with a smile
though the demons dance and sing their songs within my fevered brain
not all my god-like thoughts lord are defiled
it's the thirty-third of august and I'm finally touching down
eight days from sunday lord I'm saturday-bound
it's the thirty-third of august and I'm finally touching down
eight days from sunday lord I'm saturday-bound
met the girl that I love
in a town way down in texas
beneath the stars up above
she was the sweetest girl I ever did see
so I held her in my arms and
told her of her many charms
and I kissed her while the fiddles played
the bonaparte's retreat
all the world was bright as I held her on that night
and I heard her say "don't you ever go away"
so I held her in my arms and
told her of her many charms
and I kissed her while the guitars played
the bonaparte's retreat
[musical interlude]

i'll always be with you for as long as you please
for I am the forest but you are the trees
i'm empty without you so come grow within me
for I am the forest and you are the trees
and the heavens need romance so love never dies
you'll be the stars dear and I'll be the sky
and should any of this find us let them all be forewarned
that you are the thunder and I am the storm
and I'll always be with you for as long as you please
for I am the forest and you are the trees
and I'll always be with you for as long as you please

if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
if you could see our love directing time
if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if you only knew the values of unknowns
and if you could see transitions going on
and if my lips could speak the words the truth you'd find
if you could only see what's going through my mind
if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
and if you could see our love directing time
if you could only see what's going through my mind

i close my eyes and watch the darkness
withdraw to my world of make believe
this world is filled with so much sorrow
and I've seen all this world I care to see
i watch as castles fall around me
from crumbled ruins of my own
this world is filled with much unhappiness
so many people so alone
seeds that thrive in loveless gardens
fruits of such will bitter be
fields of hate and greed surround me
and I've seen all this world I care to see
gee but it's great after staying out late
walking my baby back home
arm and arm over meadow and farm
walking my baby back home
we go along harmonizing a song
or I'm reciting a poem
the owls go by and they give me the eye
walking my baby back home
we stop for awhile she gives me a smile
and cuddles her cheek to my chest
we started to pet and that's when I get
her powder all over my vest
just as I try to straighten my tie
she wants to borrow my comb
one kiss then we continue again
walking my baby back home
love me tender love me sweet
never let me go
you have made my dreams complete
and I love you so
love me tender love me true
all my dreams fulfill
for my darlin' I love you
and I always will
love me tender love me dear
tell me you are mine
i'll be yours through all the years
till the end of time
love me tender love me
all my dreams fulfill
for my darlin' I love you
and I always will
[verse 1]
i'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
i want them I want them to know
how I feel my love is real for my mama and daddy
i want them to know I love them so
[chorus 1]
in my heart joy tears start cause I'm happy
and I pray every day for mom and pappy and each night
i'd walk for miles cry or smile for my mama and daddy
i want them to know I love them so
[verse 2]
i'd fight in wars - do all the chores
for my mama and daddy
i want them to live on - till they're called
i'd work and slave - and never rave
for mama and daddy
because I know I owe them my all
[chorus 1]
i remember the day that clayton delaney died
they said for the last two weeks that he suffered and cried
it made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot kid
they said he got religion at the end and I'm glad that he did
clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
i thought he was a hero and I used to follow clayton around
i often wondered why clayton who seemed so good to me
never took his old guitar and made it down in tennessee
well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
i knew he used to picked up in ohio with a five piece band
clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
there ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early gray
i guess if I'd admit it clayton taught me how to drink booze
i can see him half stoned pickin' up the lovesick blues
when clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
i'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
i remember the year that clayton delaney died
nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
i know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
but it could be the good lord likes a little picking too
i remember the year that clayton delaney died
[chorus 1]
now I don't care if I'm not the first love you've known
just so I'll be the last
no I don't care if I'm not the first one you've kissed
darling I'll never ask
[chorus 2]
yesterday's gone
love me from now on
be true to me
forget about the past
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
[chorus 1]
darling I'll never ask
i know that someday you'll want me to want you
when I'm in love with somebody new
you expect me to be true and keep on loving you
though I am feeling blue you think I can't forget you
until someday you'll want me to want you
when I am strong for somebody new
and though you don't want me now I'll get along somehow
and then I won't want you
sleigh bells ring are you listening
in the lane snow is glistening
a beautiful sight we're happy tonight
walking in the winter wonderland
gone away is the bluebird
here to stay is a newbird
he sings a love song as we go along
walking in the winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build the snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say "are you married" we'll say "no man
but you can do the job when you're in town"
later on we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid the plans that we made
walking in the winter wonderland
in the meadow we can build the snowman
then pretend that he is parson brown
he'll say "are you married" we'll say "no man
but you can do the job when you're in town"
later on we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire
to face unafraid the plans that we made
walking in the winter wonderland
walking in the winter wonderland
walking in the winter wonderland
[verse 1]
i'm goin' round in circles acting like a fool
i've played the game of love
and I don't even know the rules
i gave my heart to someone
she broke it just today
and I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way
[verse 2]
i suppose I should be careful but how was I to know
she looked so sweet and innocent
but that's the way it goes
it happens to the best of us
at least that's what they say
but I'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way
somethin' sure had better change
but what am I to do
surely there's someone around
who needs a love that's true
but I guess I'll keep on searchin'
but one thing I can say
i'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way
somethin' sure had better change
but what am I to do
surely there's someone around
who needs a love that's true
but I guess I'll keep on searchin'
but one thing I can say
i'm gonna lose a lot of teardrops this way
i'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you
come rain or come shine
high as a mountain deep as a river
come rain or come shine
i guess when you met me
it was just one of those things
but don't ever bet me
'cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
you're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
come rain or come shine
we'll be happy together unhappy together
now won't that be fine
the days may be cloudy or sunny
we're in or we're out of the money
but I'm with you always
i'm with you rain or shine
i'm with you always
i'm with you rain or shine
[instrumental break]
you're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
come rain or come shine
we'll be happy together unhappy together
now won't that be fine

i'm with you rain or shine
i'm with you always
i'm with you rain or shine
those far away places with strange sound and names far away over sea
far away places with the strange sound and names are calling calling me
i go into china or maybe siam I wanna see for myself
those far away places I've been readin' bout in a book that I took from a shelf
i keep wishin' I was somewhere else way on a train
i pray for the day I can get under way and search for those castles in spain
they call me a dreamer well maybe I am but I'm never longin' to see
the strange far away places with the strange sound and names calling calling me
calling calling me
now that we're back together the battle is half won
we'll try to save a part of yesterday
i know it won't be easy but at least we have begun
there is no easy way but there is a way
we both could use some understanding trust would help
and the journey of a thousand miles begins with just one step
and is love not worth the price we'll have to pay
there is no easy way but there is a way
there is no easy way but there is a way
[verse 1]
the turning earth will raise its wand
and bring the seasons to their fruitful end
and little men and trains will crawl
and snake their way around the timeless bend
and rivers too will course their way
to find the hungry mother sea at last
and love will grow it will come to pass
[verse 2]
the sun will blaze its scorching path
across the sky a million times or more
and men with charts will scan the skies
in quest of life on some forgotten shore
and in the quiet womb the sleeping seed
will stretch its arms and grow at last
and love will grow it will come to pass
it will come to pass
[verse 3]
though men and minds and times will change
still pinioned they by fears of growing old
though scalpeled hands will plumb the deepest corners
none will find the soul
yet bearded men in sandwich boards
will tell the sinful streets "he's come at last"
and love will grow it will come to pass
the way you wear your hat
the way you sip your tea
the memory of all that
no no they can't take that away from me
the way your smile just beams
the way you sing off-key
the way you haunt my dreams
no no they can't take that away from me
we may never never meet again
on this bumpy road to love
still I'll always always keep the memory of
the way you hold your knife
the way we danced till three
the way you've changed my life
no no they can't take that away from me
no they can't take that away from me
[pre-chorus 1]
moonlight becomes you it goes with your hair
you certainly know the right thing to wear
moonlight becomes you I'm thrilled at the sight
and we could get so romantic tonight
[chorus 1]
you're all dressed up to go dreaming
now don't tell me I'm wrong
what a night to go dreaming
mind if I tag along
[chorus 2]
moonlight becomes you
and I want you to know
it's not just because there's moonlight
although moonlight becomes you so
[pre-chorus 1]
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
send me a picture
when we were together
and we held the world
in the palm of our hands
when life had a future
forever and ever
send me that picture again
how long do you hold on
to dreams that don't come true
although you dream them again and again
well one night I'll dream
and it won't be about you
i don't think so
how long has it been
i write all these words
but you'll never see them
'cause I'll never send them
i'll just throw them away
or hide them somewhere
where no one will find them
so send me that picture today
i used to think time
would make it all better
but I have learned better
as time passed away
and I've almost forgotten
what it was that I lived for
so send me that picture today
i write all these words
but you will never see them
'cause I'll never send them
i'll just throw them away
or hide them somewhere
where no one will find them
so send me that picture today
send me a picture
when we were together
when we held the world
in the palm of our hands
when life had a future
forever and ever
send me that picture again
send me that picture again
[verse 1]
she tries to give up on love every morning
and there's that ceiling and there she is by herself
wondering if she'll ever find that feeling
till there's that someone there'll be no one else
see the woman won't give her heart away to just anyone
even though the strongest will don't like to wait
a heart'll do just about anything to feel love
and love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to make
[verse 2]
a cup of coffee on the dresser putting on her make up
she looks in the mirror and the mirror has something to say
that loneliness that needing and that wanting
they're all part of longing they're your saving grace
hey woman don't give your heart away to just anyone
even though the strongest will don't like to wait
a heart'll do just about anything to feel love
and love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to make
she believes though she hasn't found him yet
the stronger her faith the closer she get's
so the woman won't give her heart away to just anyone
even though the strongest will don't like to wait
a heart'll do just about anything to feel love
and love's the one and only thing her heart
and love's the one and only thing her heart really want's to make
it's very clear
our love is here to stay 
not for a year
but ever and a day
the radio and the telephone
and the movies that we know
may just be passing fancies
and in time may go 
but oh my dear
our love is here to stay
together we're
going a long long way
in time the rockies may crumble
gibralter may tumble
there're only made of clay
but our love is here to stay
[verse 1]
one time she loved you
and though you still feel the same
love is always the loser
when pride plays the game
[verse 2]
she would never admit she was wrong
and you just couldn't give in
now you're both a loser
and pride wins again
[instumental break]
[verse 2]
she would never admit that she was wrong
and you just couldn't give in
now you're both a loser
and pride wins again

i've been walking in the shadows for so long that I forgot the sun can shine
i've turned away from everyone and everything that wanted to be mine
somehow I always shot my eyes and heart to everything that I could share
now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there
[verse 2]
and every path I've taken I have turned around and quickly closed the door
it seems as though I knew if I ever stop to feel I want more
i kept a steady run so my eyes could never focus anywhere
now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there
how long have you been standing there protecting me from love that shouldn't be
knowing all alone that I could realize that you were meant for me
[verse 3]
now I've got to mend every broken fence and bridge that I have burned
i've got to clear away the cobwebs in my heart so I can start to learn
for I realize that you've been waiting just to teach me how to care
now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there
and now I'm standing still and I'm wondering just how long have you been there
i know why I waited
know why I've been blue
i've been waiting each day
for someone exactly like you
why should I spend some money
on a show or two
when nobody sings these love songs
exactly like you
you make me feel so grand
i want to give this world to you
you make me understand
these foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
and schemes I'm scheming
now I know why my mama
she taught me to be true
she knew just around the corner
was somebody like you
you make me feel so grand
i want to give this world to you
you make me understand
these foolish little dreams I'm dreaming
and schemes I'm scheming
now I know why my mama
she taught me to be true
she knew just around the corner
was somebody like you
give me just one more sip of that worry b gone
i'm planning on feeling much better before too long

she always follows me from town to town at least her memories follow me around
whenever I clear my mind so she can see I feel her love come rushing into me
i know that I will never be the law looks as though her memory's bound to haunt
and I know my love will always stay in bounds
with her memory always follow me around
follow me around follow me around follow me around follow me around
and I know my love will always stay in bounds
with her memory always following me around
follow me around follow me around
with her memory always following me around
well it's four am and you're just getting in
your first night out and I won't ask you where you've been
you're so ashamed and your eyes just can't meet mine
you've seen that look on me a thousand times
what makes us do the things we do heaven only knows
we think we have a secret but it always shows
and I taught you how to cheat you're doing fine
you've seen that look on me a thousand times
but I still love you and so I pretend and hope I'll never see that look again
but if we do I know the fault is mine I've seen that look on me a thousand times
i've seen that look on me a thousand times
i'd like to say that I tried
fits in with all deceptions and lies
and empty tables with food untouched
i couldn't see the future
and I liked it too much
i've been goin' from door to door
with nothing to sell
wanderin' like a fool through the halls of a blue hotel
go on and rain down on us
go on and rain
go on and rain down on us
i give up I give up
somethin' about her is cold
blowin through the trees
leavin me wrong
as the words come out
i get confused I get shattered like a lightbulb in october
she's inside me like a secret
and I got no one to tell
and wanderin' like a fool through the halls of blue hotel
go on and rain down on us
go on and rain
go on and rain down on us
i give up I give up
i give up I give up
go on and rain down on us
go on and rain down
when the storms of life are raging stand by me
when the storms of life are raging stand by me
when the world is tossing me like a ship upon the sea
thou who rulest wind and water stand by me
when the midst of tribulation stand by me
when the midst of tribulation stand by me
when the hosts of hell assail and my strength begins to fail
thou who never lost a battle stand by me
when the midst of faults and failures stand by me
when the midst of faults and failures stand by me
when I do the best I can and my friends misunderstand
thou who knowest all about me stand by me
when I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
when I'm growing old and feeble stand by me
when my life becomes a burden and I'm nearing chilly jordan
o thou lily of the valley stand by me
nobody said it was gonna be easy
it's only as hard as it seems
but lately it's harder than usual
am I dreaming impossible dreams
will you love me forever I don't even know
and I don't really care anymore
nobody said it was gonna be easy
it never was easy before
will you love me forever I don't even know
and I don't really care anymore
nobody said it was gonna be easy
it never was easy before
it never was easy before
if you can't say you love me say you hate me
and that you regret each time you held me tight
if you can't be mine forever then forsake me
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it was right when you loved me only
but wrong when you held another tight
so before you go away and leave me lonely
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
so please help me to face the new tomorrows
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart
i gotta walk alone
my sweetheart's gone
nobody here loves me now
it's a long and lonesome road
i've got to walk alone
all the friends I knew
by two and two
have left me one by one
it's a long and lonesome road
i've got to walk alone
don't know where
don't even care
i just keep walking on and on
all the friends I knew
by two and two
have left me one by one
it's a long and lonesome road
i've got to walk alone
how many times have you heard someone say
"if I had his money I'd do things my way"
but little they know that it's so hard to find
one rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
once I was winning in fortune and fame
everything that I dreamed for to get a start in life's game
but suddenly it happened I lost every dime
but I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
money can't buy back your youth when you're old
or a friend when you're lonely or a love that's grown cold
the wealthiest person is a pauper at times
compared to the man with a satisfied mind
when life has ended my time has run out
my friends and my loved ones I'll leave there's no doubt
but one thing for certain when it comes my time
i'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind
i'm a lonely little mansion for sale
furnished with everything but love
[verse 1]
i'm looking for someone to come live in me
i've got a large picture window and a yard filled with trees
the sign reads two stories and that's all that's for sale
but there's so many stories I could tell
[verse 2]
my windows are closed and I'm gasping for air
my carpets are spotted with tear stains here and there
a torn photograph still lies on my floor
and two sweethearts don't live here anymore
i'm a lonely little mansion for sale
and for someone I'd fit just like a glove
i'm a lonely little mansion for sale
furnished with everything but love
there's a guitar in the corner
that used to have a song
i would hold it while it played me
and I would sing along
there was a happy song about her
loving me like I loved her
but the strings no longer ring
and things are not the way they were
now when I need a song
my mind goes back where I belong
when I'm not there
and the future is not clear
and the past is just a smoke ring in the air
and that guitar in the corner
just waits there by the wall
standing guard and thinking
a new song might come to call
and free us from this minor key
that we both been living in
and will pick up where we left off
and play some songs again
now when I need a song
my mind goes back where I belong
i'm not there and the future is not clear
and the past is just a smoke ring in the air
that guitar in the corner
just waits there by the wall
standing guard and thinking
a new song might come to call
and free us from this minor key
that we've both been living in
and we look it up where we left off
and play some songs again
there's a guitar in the corner
that used to have our songs
i would hold it when I played it
and I would sing along
[verse 1]

and I ain't complaining wouldn't waste my breath to bother

i married rebbecca back in seventy-seven

me and my family ain't that how you're supposed to do
but I'm tired lord I'm tired
life is wearing me smooth down to the bone
no rest for the weary ya just move on
and I'm tired
[verse 2]
only missed six days and nights of twenty years of working
money went to taxes and these bills I've paid on time
raise I got six months ago don't meet the cost of living
selling my body for these nickels and these dimes
the smell of becky's coffee rolled me out of bed this morning
i showered and I shaved and dressed and pulled my work boots on
walked in the kitchen and she was staring out of the window
and the way she said good morning
made me ask "is something wrong"
she said "i'm tired I woke up tired"
life is wearing me smooth down to the bone
no rest for the weary ya just move on
and I guess we'll just keep going till we're gone
and I'm tired lord I'm tired
said "i'm tired" lord I'm tired
[verse 1]
big jim butcher was the king of the hill
he ran his business with a deadly will
his foreman john had a pretty wife
the way she looked cut jim like a knife
john was weak and his wife was too
her name was kate and she fell in too
she let big jim do what he had to do
and john stood by and his life was through
it was all in the name of love
all in the name of love
you can't change the stars above
all in the name of love
[verse 2]
john took a bottle one drink at a time
stared off in space as he lost his mind
knew who it was on the telephone
he saw it all and he felt so alone
one dark morning john stood up like a man
he took his shotgun with a steady hand
he went to the motel broke the door in
he left two holes where two hearts had been
[verse 3]
he called the preacher and he called the law
and when they got there it was pretty raw
he said"boys you better come and take me away
i've done all I can do in the name of love today"
when this world began
it was heaven's plan
there should be a girl for ev'ry single man
to my great regret
someone has upset
heaven's pretty progamme for we've never met
i'm clutching at straws just because
i may meet him/her yet
somebody loves me I wonder who
i wonder who he/she can be
somebody loves me I wish I knew
who can he/she be worries me
for ev'ry boy/girl who passes me I shout " hey maybe
you were meant to be my loving baby "
somebody loves me I wonder who
maybe it's you
right or wrong I'll always love you
though you're gone I can't forget
right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
though I wake with that same old regret
all along I knew I'd lose you
still I prayed that you'd be true
in your heart you love another
but right or wrong I'm still in love with you
[instrumental break]
right or wrong I'll always love you
though you're gone I can't forget
right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
though I wake with that same old regret
all along I knew I'd lose you
still I prayed that you'd be true
oh lord in your heart you love another
right or wrong I'm still in love with you
oh lord
[verse 1]
from the great atlantic ocean
to the wide pacific shore
to the queen of flowing mountains
for the hills and by the shore
she's mighty tall and handsome
and she's known quite well by all
she came down from birmingham
on the wabash cannonball
well now listen to the jingle
to the rumble and the roar
as she glides along the woodland
through the hills and by the shore
hear the mighty rush of the engine
and the lonesome hoboes call
no changes can be taken
on the wabash cannonball
[verse 2]
now here's to daddy claxton
may his name forever stand
he'll always be remembered
in the ports throughout the land
his earthly race is over
and the curtain round him falls
we'll carry him home to glory
[verse 1]
each time that I hold you close here in my arms
i'm building heartaches
each time that I kiss your lips so sweet and warm
i'm building heartaches
and when you say you love me
we both know it's a lie
and just a dream from which I must awake
that each sweet word you tell me
is a heartache in disguise
so I'm building heartaches
[verse 2]
when people ask me what I'm doing here's what I tell
i'm building heartaches
and each kiss you give me is a tear that hasn't fell
so I'm building heartaches
and when you say you love me
we both know it's a lie
and just a dream from which I must awake
that each sweet word you tell me
is a heartache in disguise
so I'm building heartaches
why must you always try to make me over
take me as I am or let me go
white lilies never grow on stalks of clover
take me as I am or let me go
you're trying to reshape me in a mold love
in the image of the one you used to know
but I won't be a stand in for an old love
take me as I am or let me go
you tried to change me ever since you've met me
take me as I am or let me go
if you can't overlook my faults forget me
take me as I am or let me go
you're trying to reshape me in a mold love
in the image of the one you used to know
but I won't be a stand in for an old love
take me as I am or let me go
[verse 1]
love that runs away from my dreams
that just won't let me be
blues that keep on bothering me
chains that just won't set me free
too far away from you and all your charms
just out of reach of my two empty arms
[verse 2]
each night in dreams I see your face
memories time cannot erase
then I awake and find you're gone and I'm so blue and all alone
too far away from you and all your charms
just out of reach of my two empty arms
that lonesome feeling all the time
knowing you could not be mine
dreams that hurt me in my sleep
vows that we could never keep
too far away from you and all your charms
just out of reach of my two empty arms
a cold november wind
can cut right through your soul
even leaves all hide away
from the wind november blows
and after all the warmth
of the summer and the fall
cold november wind
cuts the deepest of them all
a cold november wind
will catch you by surprise
you think you're safely wrapped in love
'til the wind begins to rise
and after all the warmth
of a love that had it all
a cold november wind
is the hardest way to fall
we wonder why love seasons change
when did the chill begin
perhaps our love was swept away
by a cold november wind
i've got a real important job
in a large office buildin'
ridin' people in an elevator
i drive a '57 chevrolet
with busted tail lights
burned out valves
and a leaky radiator
i wear a twenty dollar suit
i bought from jc penney's
back in 1962
but I've got somethin' to brag about
somethin' to brag about
somethin' to brag about in you
i'm a short-order cook
at an all night cafe
down on 18th avenue and 12th street
i wear a swingin' mini dress
that I made for myself
from mama's kitchen curtains
and old bed sheets
i've got 17 pages
of top value stamps
and one old pair of shoes
but I've got somethin' to brag about
somethin' to brag about
somethin' to brag about in you
when you're with the fellas I know
you start braggin' 'bout
my hour glass figure
and my big brown eyes
tell 'em
you tell your girlfriends 'bout my
sweet sweet lovin'
and that's one better that
money can't buy
so let's get married
in the not-to-distant future
we'll rent a little flat
on 29th street
you know we'll hang our washin'
on the clothes line from the window
we'll feast on corn bread butter beans and lunch meat
we won't have a thermostat
a big long cadillac
but we'll have a love that's true
love has somethin' to brag about
yeah and I'll have somethin' to brag about
yeah somthin' to brag about in you
[verse 1]
it's the way that you kiss me
it's the way that you don't
it's the way that you'll miss me
when you swear that you won't
there's a feeling you give me
when we talk on the phone
god I hope you outlive me
so I'm never alone
and whatever you do I will be there for you
through the thunder the wind and the rain
and whatever you do I will promise to you
i will be there
i will be there for you
[verse 2]
i may lack social graces
but I won't swallow my pride
see there are millions of places I could be
but I'm here by your side
though there's nothing to guide us
we will weather the storm
till the heavens divide us
i'll keep you from harm
and whatever you do I'll be there for you
through the thunder the wind and the rain
i will always be true this I promise to you
i will be there
i'll be there for you
the evening breeze caressed the trees tenderly
the trembling trees embraced the breeze tenderly
then you and I came wondering by and lost in a sigh were we
the shore was kissed by sea and mist tenderly
i can't forget how two hearts met breathlessly
your arms opened wide and closed me inside
you took my lips you took my love so tenderly
the shore was kissed by sea
i've got a lot of travellin' to do
a whole lot of travellin' to do
talk about a mover who has way too much to lose
each time I put back on my ramblin' shoes
i've got a lot of travellin' to do
i've go a lot of travellin' to do
a whole lot of travellin' to do
well the road's gettin' crowded
and they're shortenin' my view
and there ain't nothin' here that I really care to lose
i've got a lot of travellin' to do
a whole lot of travellin' to do
*and I can't forget the shit you put me thru'
and of course I can't forget you
cause that's just what I do
but I've got a lot of travellin' to do
i've got a lot of travellin' to do
a whole lot of travellin' to do
i'm gonna fire one up I'm gonna burn it down
and load it right by you
but that wouldn't write a song
there goes a man who gave his heart to someone
and I feel sorry for him
for that someone just gave her heart to me
[verse 1]
now he's the loser and it hurts so much to lose and I feel sorry for him
'cause the loser I know could have been me
[verse 2]
oh how he loved her I'm sure he must have loved her almost as much as me
but fate has frowned on him then turned around and smiled on me
there goes a man who gave his heart to someone
and I feel sorry for him
for that someone just gave her heart to me
[verse 3]
if things were different and if he had won her love instead of me
i wonder if he'd find the time to offer sympathy
there goes a man who gave his heart to someone
and I feel sorry for him
'cause that someone just gave her heart to me
[verse 1]
something in the way she moves
attracts me like no other lover
something in the way she woos me
i don't want to leave her now you know I believe and how
somewhere in her smile she knows
that I don't need no other lover
something in her style that shows me
i don't want to leave her now you know I believe and how
you're asking me will my love grow
i don't know I don't know
just stick around and it may show
i don't know I don't know
[verse 2]
something in the way she knows
and all I have to do is think of her
something in the way she shows me
i don't want to leave her now you know I believe and how
[verse 1]
some other time I'll forget you
and start my life anew
but not just now I won't forget you
'cause I've spent too much time loving you
i know I could forget you if I wanted to
but there's still ten thousand dreams that I must dream of you
some other time I'll stop rememberin'
the love that came my way
then I'll forget I ever loved you
some other time but not today
i know I could forget you if I wanted to
but there's still ten thousand dreams that I must dream of you
some other time I'll stop rememberin'
the love that came my way
then I'll forget I ever loved you
some other time but not today
there may be trouble ahead
but if there's moonlight
and music and love and romance
let's face the music and dance
before the fiddlers have fled
before they ask us to pay the bill
and while we still have the chance
let's face the music and dance
soon we'll be without the moon
humming a different tune and then
there may be teardrops to shed
but if there's moonlight
and music and love and romance
let's face the music and dance
[verse 1]
i've traveled over the country wide a seeking fortune fair
i've been down the two coast lines I've traveled everywhere
from portland east and portland west and back along the line
i'm going now to a place that's best that old home town of mine
eight more miles and louisville will come in to my view
eight more miles on this old road and I 'll never more be blue
i knew some day that I'd come back I knew it from the start
eight more miles to louisville the home town of my heart
there's sure to be a girl somewhere that you like best of all
mine lives down in louisville she's long and she is tall
but she's the kind that you can't find a rambling through the land
i'm on my way this very day to win her heart and hand
oh eight more miles and louisville
[verse 2]
now I can picture in my mind a place we'll call our home
a humble little hut for two we'll never want to roam
the place that's right for that love site is in those bluegrass hills
where gently flows the ohio by a place called louisville
dozens of girls would storm up
i had to lock my door
somehow I couldn't warm up
to one before
what was it that controlled me
what kept my love life lean
my intuition told me
you'd come on the scene
lady listen to the rhythm of my heartbeat
and you'll get just what I mean
embrace me my sweet embraceable you
embrace me you irreplaceable you
just one look at you my heart grew tipsy in me
you and you alone bring out the gypsy in me
i love all the many charms about you
above all I want my arms about
don't be a naughty baby
come to papa come to papa do
my sweet embraceable you
[verse 1]
you may be an ambassador to england or france
you may like to gamble you might like to dance

but you're gonna have to serve somebody yes indeed
you're gonna have to serve somebody
it may be the devil or it may be the lord
but you're gonna have to serve somebody

blue moon you saw me standin' alone
without a dream in heart without a love on my arm
blue moon you knew just what I was there for
you heard me say a prayer for
someone I really could care for
[chorus 1]
and there suddenly appeared before me
the only one my arms will ever hold
and I heard someone whisper "please adore me"
and when I looked the moon had turned to gold
[chorus 2]
blue moon now I'm no longer alone
without a dream in my heart
without a love all my own
[chorus 1]

sitting here in limbo waiting for the dice to roll
sitting here in limbo got some time to search my soul
well they're putting up resistance
but I know that my faith will lead me on
i don't know where life will lead me
but I know where I've been
i can't say what life will show me
but I know what I've seen
tried my hand at love and friendship
but all that is passed and gone
this little boy is moving on
sitting here in limbo waiting for the tide to flow
sitting here in limbo knowing that I have to go
well they're putting up resistance
but I know that my faith will lead me on
sitting here in limbo
limbo limbo limbo
knowing that I have to go
[repeat until fade]
[verse 1]
as you sit there in your loneliness
confused as you must be
i'm sure a dozen questions come to mind
and if you're wondering why I left you
after all you've done for me
i guess you'll have to blame it on the times
[verse 2]
the many times you had your way
no matter what the cost
and the many times you took for granted
love you now have lost
and if I've hurt you darlin'
i don't mean to be unkind
i guess you'll have to blame it on the times
[verse 3]
that small conceited world of yours
could never understand
that to want to stand alone is not a crime
and if for one time in my life
i'm acting like a man
i guess you'll have to blame it on the times
[verse 4]
blame it on the many times
a hiding place I'd seek
afraid to say what's on my mind
an' ashamed for being weak
so if at last I'm seeing
after so long being blind
i suppose you'll have to blame it on the times
oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
it goes bigger day by day please make the world go away
i was wrong the day I left you and let the world leave me astray
if you'll say that you forgive me you'll make the world go away
oh make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
i go weaker day by day please make the world go away
i'm sorry that I hurt you I'll make it up day by day
can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
make the world go away and get it off my shoulder
can you love me like you used to and make the world go away
say the things you used to say and make the world go away
i can't stand another day please make the world go away
say you'll take me back to stay and make the world go away

i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones I used to know
where the treetops glisten
and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow
i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones I used to know
where the treetops glisten
and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow
i'm dreaming of a white christmas
just like the ones I used to know
where the treetops glisten
and children listen
to hear sleigh bells in the snow
ole buttermilk sky
i'm keeping my eye peeled on you
what's the good word tonight
are you going to be mellow tonight
ole buttermilk sky
can't you see my little donkey and me
we're as happy as a christmas tree
headed for the one I love
i'm going to pop her the question that question
do you darling do you do

if I can only bank on you
ole buttermilk sky
i'm telling you why now you know
keep it in mind tonight
keep brushing those clouds from sight
ole buttermilk sky

hang a moon above her hitching post
and hitch me to the one I love

buttermilk sky
afraid to tell you how much I care
afraid I'll need you and you won't be there
i'd love to take you into my heart
but something tells me we would only part
i loved and lost just one love ago
i paid the cost and it hurt me so
a heart gets careless when vows are made
i want to love you but I'm so afraid
no one to talk with all by myself
no one to walk with but I'm happy on the shelf
ain't misbehavin' saving my love for you
i know for certain the one I love
i'm through with flirting it's just you I'm thinking of
ain't misbehavin' saving my love for you
like jack horner in the corner
don't go nowhere what do I care
your kisses are worth waiting for believe me
i don't stay out late don't care to go
i'm home about eight just me and my radio
ain't misbehavin' saving my love for you
saving my love for you
saving my love for you
if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
if you could see our love directing time
if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if you only knew the values of unknowns
and if you could see transitions going on
and if my lips could speak the words the truth you'd find
if you could only see what's going through my mind
if you could only see what's going through my mind
and if your ears could hear the rhythms and the rhymes
and if you could see our love directing time
if you could only see what's going through my mind
if you could only see what's going through my mind
if you could only see what's going through my mind
if you could only see what's going through my mind
hear me talking now
[verse 1]
you tried to make her happy
you couldn't make her happy
make way for a better man than you
[verse 2]
you tried your brand of loving
she couldn't stand your loving
make way for a better man than you
i held back 'cause you and I were friends
but old buddy this is where our friendship ends
i'm taking over now
those signals she keeps sending means your romance is ending
make way for a better man than you
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
those fancy words you told her
were not enough to hold her
make way for a better man than you
[verse 4]
i guess you ran your luck out
you came to bat and struck out
make way for a better man than you
i held back 'cause you and I were friends
but old buddy this is where our friendship ends
i'm taking over now
those signals she keeps sending means your romance is ending
make way for a better man than you
make way for a better man than you
[verse 1]
i've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be
more than the measure of what I thought others could see
good luck and fast bucks they're too few and too far between
there's catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me
[verse 2]
she stood beside me letting me know she would be
something to lean on if everything ran out on me
well fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not ever will be
the reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me
[verse 3]
it's taking me so long now that I know I believe
all that I do or say is all I ever will be
too much isn't enough for old five and dimers like me
too far and too high and too deep isn't too much to see
an old five and dimer is all I intended to be
jim uh huh jim uh huh jim
jim I did everything that I could
but your fever just wouldn't die down
so I tied your horse to the wagon bed
and last night I brought you to town
but when I got there you were gone jim
and there was nothin' nobody could do
i bought you a suit and a tie jim
and today I wore one too
jim I wore a tie today
the first one that I ever wore
and you'd have said I looked like a dummy
out of a dry goods store
jim they said a lot of things
but I don't know a thing they said
my mind kept wanderin' off down the trail
back to the times that we've had
wind her through sun and the rain
and for gold on the cuff
we've done everything in the book I guess
and a lot they'd never thought up
well jim you're ridin' on ahead
i guess that's how it has be
but when you reach those streets paved with gold jim
stake a claim out for me
[verse 1]
lying in my bed I hear the clock tick
and think of you
caught up in circles
confusion is nothing new
flashbacks warm nights
almost left behind
suitcases of memories time after
sometimes you picture me
i'm walking too far ahead
you're calling to me
i can't hear what you've said
then you say "go slow"
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if you're lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
time after time [x2]
[verse 2]
after my picture fades
and darkness has turned to gray
watching through windows
you're wondering if I'm okay
secrets stolen
from deep inside
the drum beats out of time
if you're lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
time after time
when you say "go slow"
i fall behind
the second hand unwinds
if you're lost you can look and you will find me
time after time
if you fall I will catch you and I'll be waiting
time after time [x2]
time after time time after time [x3]
after time after time
i was a highwayman along the coach roads I did ride
with sword and pistol by my side
many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade
many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade
the bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
but I am still alive
i was a sailor I was born upon the tide
and with the sea I did abide
i sailed a schooner round the horn to mexico
i went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow
and when the yards broke off they said that I got killed
but I am living still
i was a dam builder across the river deep and wide
where steel and water did collide
a place called boulder on the wild colorado
i slipped and fell into the wet concrete below
they buried me in that great tomb that knows no sound
but I am still around
i'll always be around and around and around
and around and around
i fly a starship across the universe divide
and when I reach the other side
i'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can
perhaps I may become a highwayman again
or I may simply be a single drop of rain
but I will remain and I'll be back again
and again and again and again and again
[chorus 1]
sun come up it was blue and gold [3x]
ever since I put your picture
in a frame
[verse 1]
i come calling in my sunday best [3x]
every since I put your picture
in a frame
[chorus 2]
i'm gonna love you
till the wheels come off
oh yea
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
[chorus 1][2x]
[verse 1]
you want me to love just you
while you love your share
don't you think that's a little unfair
it's me that stays home
while you stay gone
[chorus 1]
till you decide to care
don't you think that's a little unfair
[chorus 2]
i can't see how it can be anything for me
what's mine is yours
what's yours is yours
that's how you wanted to be
and you want me to wait for you
[chorus 1]
[chorus 2]
[chorus 1]
going home in this pickup
not knowing this stickup
was in progress on the same side of town
by a man in a truck
the same kind he was driving
bad karma was soon comin' down
before the store owner died
he had tried to describe
the man who had shot him that day
and he described to a letter
the innocent cowboy
so he tried him and sent him away
my world has midnight and daylight and sunsets and dawn
and your eyes like two stars that I dream upon
sometimes I'm losing and sometimes I win
life likes to make me start over again
and I don't know what I would do
if my world didn't have you
if my world didn't have you
then I'd have no reason for my dreams to come true
and somethings would just be too much to go through
if my world didn't have you
we have good days and bad days and comfort and pain
it all has a balance like sunshine and rain
you share with me the blues and the grays
and you are the key to the sense it all make
no I'd never find my way through
if my world didn't have you
if my world didn't have you
then I'd have no reasons for my dreams to come true
and somethings would just be too much to go through
if my world didn't have you
if my world didn't have you
here comes santa claus
here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer
are pulling on the reins
bells are ringing children singing
all is merry and bright
hang your stockings and say your prayers
because santa claus comes tonight
here comes santa claus
here comes santa claus
right down santa claus lane
vixen and blitzen and all his reindeer
are pulling on the reins
bells are ringing children singing
all is merry and bright
hang your stockings and say your prayers
because santa claus comes tonight
some people drink champagne out under the stars
while others drink wine leaning over a bar
but all that I need dear to make me feel fine
is to know that your love will forever be mine
i'd give an ocean of diamonds or a world filled with flowers
to hold you closely for just a few hours
hear you whisper softly that you love me too
would change all the dark clouds to bluest of blue
i don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their wine
so if you refuse me my poor heart will pine
i'll be so lonely till the day that I die
and as long as I live dear you'll still hear me cry
little bird have you heard
freedom lies freedom lies
a love like ours never dies
changing skies just changing skies
[verse 1]
do you remember how they warned you once before
they made it clear you weren't to see me anymore
within your world of riches poor boys aren't allowed
and you must learn to love someone within your crowd
[verse 2]
and though I love you more than I could ever say
the danger's much too great and you can't stay
you could never stand dishonor you're too proud
so you must learn to love someone within your crowd
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
someday you'll find someone deserving of your love
someone to kiss the lips that I'm not worthy of
and when I see you passing by I'll feel so proud
although I stand outside my heart's within your crowd
all my tears have fallen I can cry no more
i've cried so much since you have said goodbye
the pressure keeps on building up within my heart
it grows and grows but still my eyes are dry
though my heart is breakin' tears refuse to start
so I've got to find a new way to cry
i've got to find a new way to relieve the pain
it just can't stay forever locked inside
and until I forget you and can smile again
i've got to find a new way to cry
i've got to find a new way to relieve the pain
it just can't stay forever locked inside
and until I forget you and can smile again
i've got to find a new way to cry
everywhere you go sunshine follows you
and everywhere you go skies are always blue
children love you they seem to know
that you bring the roses out of the snow
and the whole world says hello everywhere you go
children love you they seem to know
you bring the roses out of the snow
and the whole world says hello everywhere you go
some other world has all the sunshine
'cause there's no sunshine in mine
out of the darkness came thunder and rain
leaving my dreams all in vain
some other world there sleeps my darling
there where the skies are always blue
why don't they take me out of this world
and let me find my sunshine with you
[instrumental break]
some other world there sleeps my darling
there where the skies are always blue
why don't they take me out of this world
and let me find my sunshine with you
i have no money in my coffer
no gold or silver do I bring
nor have I precious jewels to offer
to celebrate the newborn king
yet do not spurn my gift completely
o ye three wise men please demur
behold a plant that smokes more sweetly
than either frankincense or myrrh
and like the child born in this manger
this herb is mild yet it is strong
and it brings peace to friend and stranger
good will to men lies in this bong
and now my wonder weed is flarin'
stephen are you high
looked like that special star above
stephen can it be
pass it around in endless sharin'
stephen on christmas day
and let not mankind bogart love
stephen you'd smoke my tree
and the wise men started tokin'
and yea the bud was kind
it was salvation they were smokin'
and its forgiveness blew their minds
and still that wonder weed is flarin'
stephen are you high
looked like that star was once above
stephen you're so high
pass it around in endless sharin'
stephen dude man dude
and let not mankind bogart love
stephen you're really high
i'm gonna tell your savior
and let not mankind bogart love
it was in the summer not in the fall
i spent all my money on alcohol
and now you're gone and I don't worry
'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
no need of crying holding out your hand
'cause I can get a woman quick as you get a man
but you're gone and I don't worry
'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
if you see me stealing don't you tell on me
i'm just stealing back to old used to be's
'cause now you're gone and I don't worry
'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
it was in the summer not in the fall
i spent all my money on alcohol
and now you're gone and I don't worry
'cause I'm sitting on top of the world
a short time I have to be with you my love
but a short time is better than no time you see
so I bring to you all my posessions and would that you share them with me
i bring one springtime of robins one springtime of robins to sing
i bring you one summer of roses one summer of roses I bring
i bring you the dry leaves of autumn dry leaves will be helpful you know
to soften the fall of your snowflakes when I bring you your winter of snow
this looks like a december day this looks like a time to remember day
and I remember a spring such a sweet tender thing
and love's summer college where the green leaves of knowledge
were waiting to fall with the fall
and where september wine numbed a measure of time
through the tears of october
now november's over and this looks like a december day
this looks like a december day it's looks like we've come to the end of the way
and as my mem'ries race back to loves eager beginning
reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending the ending that won't go away
and as my mem'ries race back to loves eager beginning
reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending the ending that won't go away
and this looks like a december day
you've got to accentuate the positive
eliminate the negative
and latch on to the affirmative
don't mess with mister in-between
you've got to spread joy up to the maximum
bring gloom down to the minimum
have faith or pandemonium's
liable to walk upon the scene
to illustrate my last remark
jonah in the whale noah in the ark
what did they do just when everything looked so dark
they said you've got to accentuate
to illustrate my last remark
they said you've got to accentuate
don't mess with mister in-between
[verse 1]
casey jones he was a mighty man
but now he's resting in the promised land
the kind of music he could understand
was an eight wheel driver under his command
he made the freight train boogie
all the time
he made the freight train boogie
as he rolled down the line
[verse 2]
when the fireman started ringing the bell
everybody hung around to tell
casey jones was a coming to town on a six
eight wheeler that was flat on the ground
[verse 1]
recollection phoenix
it’s funny how the miles get into me though
it’s funny how the earth moves
and I wonder what my baby thinks of me oh
[verse 2]
recollection la
wondering who it is i’m supposed to be oh
anxious by the roadside
high on souvenirs and cappuccinos
but now I think I get it I think I understand
it’s all about hope and where you go when you get it
and I think I get it I think my head’s on straight
and I think she knows hell there goes my secret
[verse 3]
recollection phoenix
i wonder when the hell did I get older
my mind still on my woman
i wonder what she thinks of when I hold her
[verse 4]
judging by the silence
you might think the road has made her colder
but I can’t live without her
and I can’t remember if I ever told her
but now I think I get it I think I understand
it’s all about hope and where you go when you get it
and I think I get it I think my head’s on straight
and I think she knows hell there goes my secret
[verse 5]
recollection vegas
colder than it was that time in reno
listen to the night moves
go out to the girls in the casinos
but now I think I get it I think I understand
it’s all about hope and where you go when you get it
and I think I get it I think my head’s on straight
and I think she knows hell there goes my secret
go away can't you see I'm crying
go back to the new love that you've found
don't sweet talk me 'cause I ain't listening
and you'll only make things worse by hanging round
i know that I'd be crazy if I took you back again
but this foolish heart of mine might just weaken and give in
so go away I feel much better when you're gone
for you're the one who made me cry now let me cry alone
i know that I'd be crazy if I took you back again
but this foolish heart of mine might just weaken and give in
so go away I feel much better when you're gone
for you're the one who made me cry now let me cry alone
[verse 1]
he sits at my table he drinks of my wine
you'd never know he was a kin of mine
he calls me brother and then turns around
he calls me bad news to everyone in town
[verse 2]
the fun we used to have gave a warning of our fame
so soon a woman's love turned a brothers love to hate
he sits at my table and he drinks of my wine
just to be near this woman of mine
just to be near this woman of mine
[verse 1]
sometimes when the night calls it a day
and I wake up down in this missing you kind of way
and I remember things better left forgotten
[verse 2]
and sometimes when I'm holding someone new
i can't help myself I slip off and think of you
why oh why won't my mind let go of a love that used to be
and though I try in my heart I know your memory will never set me free
[verse 3]
and sometimes right out of the blue I hear a voice and I turn and look for you
why oh why won't my mind let go
sometimes when the nights calls it a day
and I wake up down in this missing you kind of way I remember
[verse 1]
you ain't nothing but trouble far as I can tell
just a wasted wish in the wishing well
but you don't know I've been here before
i'm just one too many miles from shore
and I'm taking on water and I'm going down
taking on water that's what I'm doing now
taking on water with only one way out
i gotta get my heart to higher ground
[verse 2]
oh I'm already in in too deep
i know you won't be there to rescue me
i'm already feel it right through my chest
i'm afraid if I taste it I might not catch my breath
why is a woman always thinking
just because a man is sinking
he's gonna drown
takin' on water going down
takin' on water that's what I'm doing now
takin' on water with only one way out
stay away form lonely places
follow the crowd
stay around familiar faces
play the music loud
be seen at all the parties
dress yourself in style
stay away form lonely places for awhile
stay away from lonely places
till you learn to live alone
someone's outstretched arms are waiting
to stay with you at least till dawn
remember that sorrow prospers
in a heart that never smiles
so stay away from lonely places for awhile
stay away from lonely places
it takes time to learn to live alone
and someone's outstretched arms are waiting
to stay with you at least till dawn
remember that sorrow prospers
in a heart that never smiles
so stay away from lonely places for awhile
hold back the rushing minutes
make the wind lie still
don't let the moonlight shine
across the lonely hill
dry all the raindrops
and hold back the sun
my world has ended
my baby's gone
[verse 1]
the milk man whistles softly
as he comes up to my door
the mail man brings the letters by
just like he did before
they seem so busy all day long
as though there's nothing wrong
don't they know the world has ended
my baby's gone
[verse 2]
i wake up sometimes in the night
and realize you're gone
and then I toss upon my bed
and wait for day to come
i try to tell my lonely heart
it must go on alone
but it cries the world has ended
my baby's gone
[verse 1]
in a way I'm glad it's over
even though it's going to hurt me once you're gone
but I can learn to live without you
give me time and I can make it on my own
loving you to me came easy
and losing you will change my life no doubt
in a way I'm glad it's over
but another way it turns me inside out
[verse 2]
in a way I guess it's better
even though there's nothing good about goodbye
but I know I couldn't hold you
now you found your wings and you need room to fly
loving you to me came easy
and losing you will change my life no doubt
in a way I'm glad it's over
but another way it turns me inside out
[verse 3]
on the one hand I know I'll be better off once you're gone
but I find a lot of heartaches on the other
and I can't say that I look forward to those nights I'll be alone
and I wonder if there'll ever be another
loving you to me came easy
and losing you will change my life no doubt
in a way I'm glad it's over
but another way it turns me inside out
in a way I'm glad it's over
in another way it turns me inside out
[verse 1]
what now my love now that you've left me
how can I live through another day
watching my dreams turn into ashes
and my hopes into bits of clay
[verse 2]
once I could see once I could feel
now I am numb I've become unreal
i walk the night without a goal
stripped of my heart and my soul
[verse 3]
what now my love now that it's over
i feel the world closing in on me
here come the stars tumbling around me
and there's the sky where the sea should be
[verse 4]
what now my love now that you're gone
i'd be a fool to go on and on
no one would care no one would cry
if I should live or if I should die
[verse 5]
what now my love now there is nothing
only my last goodbye
only my last my last goodbye
[chorus 1]
once I thought I loved just you
and I thought you loved me too
but today you say we're through
now just look what thoughts will do
[verse 1]
now another wears the crown
and you think that you have found
just what makes your world go round
watch those thoughts they'll get you down
and if within your future years
your new love should bring you tears
then you'll think of me I'm sure
but those thoughts won't help you dear
[chorus 1][x2]
[chorus 1]
haven't got a worry haven't got a care
haven't got a thing to call my own
though I'm out of money I'm a millionaire
i still have my home in san antone
[verse 1]
when I greet my neighbor with a hi you all
i'm wealthy as a king upon a throne
[chorus 2]
and when I feel like bragging I just up and say
i'm a native son of san antone
[verse 2]
well I travel around the country on my merry way
i've been to crowds and felt I was alone
[chorus 2]
[chorus 3]
and there's a sweet somebody by the alamo
someday she's gonna be my very own
we'll buy a high chair in a year or so
for our little home in san antone
[chorus 1]
[chorus 3]
i'm a native son of san antone
for our little home in san antone
if you can't say you love me say you hate me
and that you regret each time you held me tight
if you can't be mine forever please forsake me
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it was right when you loved me only
but wrong when you held another tight
and before you go away and leave me lonely
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say your heart is filled with sorrow
you can't undo what's done why do you try
and before you go away and leave me lonely
if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
it's too late to say
and if you can't undo the wrong undo the right
[verse 1]
i'm sitting in the railway station got a ticket for a destination
on a tour of one night stands my suitcase and guitar in hand
and every stop is neatly planned for a poet and a one man band
homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound
[verse 2]
home where my thought's escaping home where my music's playing
home where my love lies waiting silently for me
every day's an endless stream of cigarettes and magazines
and each town looks the same to me for movies and the factories
and every stranger's face I see reminds me that I long to be
homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound
[verse 3]
but all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity
like emptiness and harmony I need someone to comfort me
homeward bound I wish I was homeward bound
[verse 1]
well I spent my whole lifetime
in a world where the sunshine
finds excuses for not hanging 'round
i squandered emotions
on the slightest of notions
and the first easy loving I found
but soon all the good times
the gay times and play times
like colors run together and fade
oh lord if you hear me
touch me and hold me
and keep me from blowing away
[verse 2]
there's times when I trembled
when my mind remembered
the days that just crumbled away
with nothing to show
but these lines that I know
are beginning to show in my face
oh lord if you're listening
i know I'm no christian
and I ain't got much coming to me
so send down some sunshine
throw out your lifeline
and keep me from blowing away
[verse 1]
i'm born to lose I've lived my life in vain
every dream has only brought me pain
all my life I've always been so blue
born to lose and now I'm losing you
[verse 2]
born to lose it seems so hard to bear
how I long to always have you near
you've grown tired and now you say we're through
born to lose and now I'm losing you
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
i'm born to lose my every hope is gone
it's so hard to face an empty dawn
and you were all the happiness I knew
i'm born to lose and now I'm losing you
dear one the world is waiting for the sunrise
every road is heavy heavy with dew
the crush on high his sleepy mate is calling
and my heart is calling you
dear one the world is waiting
[verse 1]
your love is as cold as the north wind blows
and the river that runs to the sea
how can I go on when your only love is gone
i can see this is no place for me
the light in your eyes is still shining
it shines but it don't shine for me
it's a story so old another love grown cold
i can see this is no place for me
[instrumental break]
the light in your eyes is still shining
it shines but it don't shine for me
it's a story so old another love grown cold
i can see this is no place for me
[verse 1]
i wish I could laugh when I look way back
find out who stole all my dreams
oh I wish it was easy to face the past
there was nobody there but me
[verse 2]
and it's hard not to smile when I'm back on high ground
and I'm wishing that someone could see
then the sun comes up and the dreams die down
[verse 3]
it feels so good to be back on dry ground
after drifting so long at sea
and when the sun comes up and the dreams die down
i never go around mirrors
it just tears me up
to see a grown man cry
and I never go around mirrors
cause I've got a heartache to hide
forgetting you darling is not my decision
for love has a mind of its own
[verse 1]
i'd love to forget every time that you kissed me
i'd love to forget that you're gone
and I'd gladly hold back each tear that I'm crying
but love has a mind of its own
love is the ruler the greatest of kings
love sits up high on a throne
forgetting you darling is not my decision
for love has a mind of it's own
[verse 2]
i don't want to carry this worrysome heartache
i don't want to cry all night long
i wish I could run from the day that I met you
but love has a mind of its own
love is the ruler the greatest of kings
love sits up high on a throne
forgetting you darling is not my decision
for love has a mind of it's own
love has a mind of it's own
glad that I ain't used to her no more
glad that I ain't used to her no more
she always burned my bacon
and she could never shut a door
and I'm glad that I ain't used to her no more
i wish I wasn't used to her back then
i wish I wasn't used to her back then
could've picked a good girl who did not crave other men
and I wish I wasn't used to her back then
when I start gettin' used to her
i get down on my knees
say "lord I know not what I do"
forgive and help me please
when I get used to her I'm sick of me
when I get used to her I'm sick of me
i want to run and hide
like a kitten up a tree
when I get used to her I'm sick of me
when I start gettin' used to her
i get down on my knees
say "lord I know not what I do"
forgive and help me please
once we said for better or for worse
'til one of us was riding in a hearse
it's same the same old song we just wrote another verse
and gettin' used to her is gettin' worse
so I'm glad that I ain't used to her no more
i'm glad that I ain't used to her no more
this song is finally over and it sure has been a chore
and I'm glad that I ain't used to her no more
and I'm glad that I ain't used to her no more
[verse 1]
once more with feeling once more with feeling
won't you hold me till the night fades into day
once more with feeling once more with feeling
hold me close don't let this feeling go away
[verse 2]
sometimes myself runs back to you
i just can't tell me what to do
but I remember when all wrapped up tight within
the shelter of my arms you used to stay
once more with feeling
once more with feeling
[verse 1]
nobody slides my friend
it's a truth on which you can depend
if you're living a lie it will eat you alive
and nobody slides my friend
[verse 2]
nobody slides my friend
you can try it but you'll never win
you can scream you can shout
but it all evens out
and nobody slides my friend
[verse 3]
nobody slides my friend
listen I'll say it again
you can run you can hide
but it's still waiting inside
and nobody slides my friend
[verse 1]
in this time that I've been given
to fill my life with livin'
i hope I have done the best that i can do
yes regrets I've got a few
but honey none of them is you
and I need you like a singer needs a song
i don't know if heaven's real
but that's how you've made me feel
you make it all alright
when everything's wrong
and this is our song
[verse 2]
in these miles we have traveled
you've watched me come unraveled
and you put me back together again
and when darkness would come around
you kept my feet there on the ground
and you held me like a lover and a friend
i don't know if heaven's real
but that's how you've made me feel
you make it all alright
when everything's wrong
and this is our song
and this is our song
and this is our song
this is our song
[verse 1]
you asked me if I'd care if you danced with joe
i said yes it's all right but my heart whispered no
for inside I was crying for last night it was jim
must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them
[verse 2]
could it be maybe I'm just imagining things
do I believe I'm second with you
only you know the answer is it me joe or jim
must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them
[instrumental break]
only you know the answer is it me joe or jim
must I play second fiddle while you're dancing with them
every night you go to bed crying
there's nothing left to do when love is dying
so before the whole world knows how we're hurtin
don't you think it's time we pulled the curtains
so many times I talked you out of leavin'
and so many times you've tried to fight the feeling
i guess we've tried and failed once too often
now the suitcase down the hallway does the talking
that just about does it don't it
that'll just about kill it won't it
maybe we should call a truce
we could but what's the use
that just about does it don't it
it's sad to think that words could come between us
and what I said god knows I didn't mean it
it's time we realized this time it's over
it's tearing us apart to stay together
and that just about does it don't it
that'll just about kill it won't it
maybe we should call a truce
we could but what's the use
that just about does it don't it
maybe we should call a truce
we could but what's the use
that just about does it don't it
my heart takes walks with her on cold and rainy days
she leads my heart along where only love can lead the way
and I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
she makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl
she makes to proud to walk the streets of anywhere
and if our bed be grass or cotton she won't care
and I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
she makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl
and I know she'll follow me to the end of the world
she makes me proud to say that she's my kind of girl
we wish you a merry christmas
we wish you a merry christmas
we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year
good tidings we bring to you and your kin
we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year
we wish you a merry christmas
we wish you a merry christmas
we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year
good tidings we bring to you and your kin
we wish you a merry christmas and a happy new year
days can be sunny
with never a sigh
don't need what money can buy
birds in the tree sing
their dayful of song
why shouldn't we sing along 
i'm chipper all the day
happy with my lot
how do I get that way 
look at what I've got
i got rhythm
i got music
i got my maingirl
who could ask for anything more 
i got daisies
in green pastures
i got my maingirl
who could ask for anything more 
ol'man trouble
i don't mind him
you won't find him
'round my door
i got starlight
i got sweet dreams
i got my maingirl
who could ask for anything more 
who could ask for anything more 
o little town of bethlehem
how still we see thee lie
above thy deep and dreamless sleep
the silent stars go by
yet in thy dark streets shine
the everlasting light
the hopes and fears of all the years
are met in thee tonight
for christ is born of mary
and gathered all above
while mortals sleep the angels keep
their watch of wondering love
o morning stars together
proclaim the holy birth
and praises sing to god the king
and peace to men on earth
how silently how silently
the wondrous gift is given
so god imparts to human hearts
the blessings of his heaven
no ear may hear his coming
but in this world of sin
where meek souls will receive him
still the dear christ enters in
where children pure and happy
pray to the blessed child
where misery cries out to thee
son of the mother mild
where charity stands watching
and faith holds wide the door
the dark night wakes the glory breaks
and christmas comes once more
o holy child of bethlehem
descend to us we pray
cast out our sin and enter in
be born in us today
we hear the christmas angels
the great glad tidings tell
o come to us abide with us
our lord emmanuel
i went to a turkey roast down the street
the people down there are eatin' like wild geese
so I'm on my way I'm goin' back in alabam
well you talk about your people havin' a lot of time
eating up their chickens and drinkin' their wine
i'm on my way I'm goin' back to alabam
now some folks say that a tramp won't steal
but I caught three in my corn field
and I'm on my way I'm goin' back to alabam
well one had a bushel and one had a peck
and one had a roaster near tied around his neck
i'm on my way I'm goin' back to alabam
well there comes sal walkin' down the street
with the run down shoes tied on her feet
i'm on my way I'm goin' back to alabam
when I get ready to leave this earth
i'm going back to my money's worth
i'm on my way I'm goin' back to alabam
well she don't love me but she loves my automobile
she don't love me but she loves my automobile
she'll do anything just to slide behind the wheel
she says what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down
she says what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down
i said honey won't you ask me when we hit the outskirts of town
she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
long as she got the keys and there's a spare tire in the trunk
release me darling let me go I don't love you anymore
to live together is a sin release and let me love again
oh I have found a new love dear and I'll always want her near
her lips are warm while yours are cold release me darling let me go
please release me let me go
[chorus 1]
listen to my song
and if you want to sing along
it's about where I belong
sometimes far into the night
and until the morning light
i pray with all my might
to be in texas
[chorus 2][2x]
it's where I want to be
the only place for me
where my spirit can be free
[chorus 1]
dusty skies I can't see nothing in sight
good old dan you'll have to guide me right
if we lose our way the cattle will stray
and we lose them all tonight
with all of the grass and water's gone
we'll have to keep the cattle moving on
sand blowing I just can't breathe in this air
thought it would soon be clear and fair
but the dust storms were bad they took all we had
i've got to be moving somewhere
i hate to leave the old ranch so bare
but I've got to be moving somewhere
so get along doggies we're moving off of this range
never thought as how I'd make the change
but the blue skies have failed we're on our last trail
underneath these dusty skies
these ain't tears in my eyes
just sand from these dusty skies
a foggy day in a london town
well it had me low and it had me down
i viewed the mornin' with alarm
at the british museum had somehow lost it's charm
how long I wonder could this thing last
well the age and the miracles well it hadn't passed
suddenly I saw you standin' there
in a foggy london town the sun was shinin' everywhere
[instrumental interlude]

i'll never understand dear as long as I live
i guess I will always wonder why
you told me that you loved me with all of your heart
and then without a warning said goodbye
the loving lies that I believed
and now how I grieve
you didn't mean it from the start
and you told me loving lies and broke my heart
[verse 2]
you say I'll soon forget you and find someone new
but darling how wrong you are
i only had one love dear and that was for you
and from that love my heart will bear the scar
loving lies that I believed
and now how I grieve
you didn't mean it from the start
so you told me loving lies and broke my heart
so you told me loving lies and broke my heart
i thought I left you
what part of we can't make it don't you understand
it's no longer you and me there's another world we'll see
i thought I left you so why aren't you leaving me
i thought I left you
what part of "it's all over" don't you understand
you fell out of love with me so I moved on quietly
i thought I left you so what aren't you leaving me
you're like the measles you're like the whooping cough
i've already had you so why in heaven's name can't you just get lost
i thought I left you
so don't you think it's time you're leaving me
i thought I left you
so don't you think it's time you let me leave
the bus is leaving it's already left the parking lot
and I checked the list to see if you were on it
searched around and thankfully you're not
i thought I left you
don't you think it's time you're leaving me
i thought I left you
don't you think it's time you let me be

johnny macon has a wife and one child on the way
and houston's running out of jobs and there are bills to pay
johnny's flying standby to alaska on a chance
he hears them calling all aboard his life is not a dance
all aboard the sky train there must be better times
and we keep moving down the line all aboard the sky train
[verse 2]
kerry jackson lost her man to whiskey and cocaine
and all she saw in florida were memories of pain
and the money from the condo won't last her very long
and so she's flying out today her life is not a song
all aboard the sky train the sun will always shine
up where those lonesome engines whine all aboard the sky train
[verse 3]
refugees on winds of war with nothing in their eyes
midnight bands on endless tours in search of endless highs
airports in the morning ahen truth is all around
we're restless millions moving on the lost and not yet found
all aboard the sky train there must be better times
if we keep moving down the line all aboard the sky train
one night when the moon was bright on the moonlit bay
that is where I found my little cherokee maid
the memory of the that night of love is lingering yet
and I know I never will forget
my little cherokee maiden I love her so
and though we're far apart
i know I'll never be trading my love for her
for anybody else's heart
someday I'll make a trip back to that cherokee strip
and I'll carry her away with me
and straight as an arrow flies
we'll ride to paradise
my sweet little chickadee
my little cherokee maiden and me
away in a manger
no crib for his bed
the little lord jesus
laid down his sweet head
the stars in the heavens
looked down where he lay
the little lord jesus
asleep on the hay
the cattle are lowing
the poor baby wakes
but little lord jesus
no crying he makes
i love thee lord jesus
look down from the sky
and stay by my cradle
till morning is nigh
be near me lord jesus
i ask thee to stay
close by me forever
and love me I pray
bless all the dear children
in thy tender care
and fit us for heaven
to live with thee there
away in a manger
no crib for his bed
the little lord jesus
laid down his sweet head
the stars in the heavens
looked down where he lay
the little lord jesus
asleep on the hay
some people say a man is made outta mud
a poor man's made outta muscle and blood
muscle and blood and skin and bones
a mind that's a-weak and a back that's strong
you load sixteen tons what do you get
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
i owe my soul to the company store
i was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine
i picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine
i loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal
and the straw boss said "well a-bless my soul"
you load sixteen tons what do you get
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
i owe my soul to the company store
i was born one mornin' it was drizzlin' rain

i was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion
cain't no-a high-toned woman make me walk the line
you load sixteen tons what do you get
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
i owe my soul to the company store
if you see me comin' better step aside
a lotta men didn't a lotta men died
one fist of iron the other of steel
if the right one don't a-get you
then the left one will
you load sixteen tons what do you get
another day older and deeper in debt
saint peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go
i owe my soul to the company store
she always follows me from town to town
at least her memories follow me around
whenever I clear my mind so she can see
i feel her love come rushing into me
and I know that I will never be alone
it looks as though her memory's bound to haunt
and I know my love will always stay in bounds
with her memory always following me around
following me around following me around
following me around following me around
and I know my love will always stay in bounds
with her memory always following me around
following me around following me around
following me around following me around
and I know my love will always stay in bounds
with her memory always following me around
with her memory always following me around
the sun goes down it leaves me sad and blue
the iron curtain falls on this cold war with you
through you won't speak and I won't speak that's true
two stubborn people with a cold war to go through
why oh why should love ever come to couples like you and me
whose cold cold wars are never won and whose hearts just can't be free
oh let's do right or let's just say we're through
i just can't stand another cold cold war with you
i just can't stand another cold cold war with you
i'm writing you this note to say I'm sorry
that spelled s-o are you ever coming home
can you find it in your heart dear to forgive me
but that's spelled f-o how I miss you since you're gone
there are so many things that I want to say tonight
but my mind keeps moving faster than my pen can write
but I hope and pray somehow the message still gets through
that's spelled m-e-s-s-a-g I love you
[instrumental break]
there are so many things that I want to say tonight
but my mind keeps moving faster than my pen can write
but I hope and pray somehow the message still gets through
that's spelled m-e-s-s-a-g I love you
you made me leave my happy home
you took my love and now you're gone
since I fell for you
love brings such misery and pain
i guess I'll never be the same
since I fell for you
and it's too bad and it's too sad
but I'm still in love with you
and you love me and then you snub me
what can I do I am still in love with you
i guess I'll never see the light
i get the blues most every night
since I fell for you since I fell for you
it's always now
and nothing ever goes away
everything is here to stay
and it's always now
it's always now
there never was a used to be
everything is still with me
and it's alawys now
so brace your heart

it's more than just a memory
and it's always now
and here's your part
sing it like a melody
there's really only you and me
and it's always now
well I'm sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
yeah I'm sitting here wondering will a matchbox hold my clothes
[verse 1]
i ain't got no matches but I got a long way to go
i'm an old poor boy and a long long way from home
i'm an old poor boy and a long long way from home
and I'll never be happy cause everything I do is wrong yeah
[verse 2]
i ain't got no matches but I got a long way to go
honey let me be your little dog 'till your big dog comes
honey let me be your little dog 'till your big dog comes

i got no matches got a long way to go
[verse 1]
so he told you that you're the dream that he's been searching for
and he told you that he's never met anyone like you before
and I can hear him telling you your lips taste just like sherry wine
but did he tell you that he's known as johnny one time
did he tell you that your heart will soon become another trinket on his bracelet of broken hearts
did he tell you that the morning sun will find you patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts
did he tell you that the special love you're saving will disappear in flames of shame like mine
did he tell you that he's known as johnny one time
[verse 2]
so he told you that he'd never lead your heart astray
and he told you that he'd love you forever and a day
and I can hear him telling you that he's the shy and bashful kind
but did he tell you that he's known as johnny one time
did he tell you that your heart will soon become another trinket on his bracelet of broken hearts
and did he tell you that the morning sun will find you patching up your shattered pride and searching for the missing parts
and did he tell you that the special love you're saving will disappear in flames of shame like mine
did he tell you that he's known as johnny one time
some enchanted evening
you may see a stranger
you may see a stranger
across a crowded room
[verse 1]
and somehow you know
you know even then
that somewhere you'll see her
again and again
some enchanted evening
you may see a stranger
you may see a stranger
across a crowded room
[verse 2]
and night after night
as strange as it seems
the sound of her laughter
will sing in your dreams
who can explain it
who can tell you why
fools give you reasons
wise men never try
some enchanted evening
you may see a stranger
you may see a stranger
across a crowded room
[verse 3]
fly to her side
and make her your own
or all through your life
you may dream all alone
once you have found her
never let her go
once you have found her
never her let her go
[verse 1]
take my word for what I tell you
i have never lied to you
pay no mind to what they're saying
i have never been untrue
evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
you'll have to take my word when I tell you
i love you I love you I love you
[verse 2]
the power of gossip is always strengthen
when it finds a respected ear
if you listen the chances are greater
that a thread of doubt may appear
evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
you'll have to take my word when I tell you
i love you I love you I love you
evil tongues in town continue to print aloud their evil news
you'll have to take my word when I tell you
i love you I love you I love you
take my word I love you take my word I love you
[verse 1]
when we look into each other's eyes
our hearts aren't beating wildly as they beat before
and when we hold each other in our arms
we can't receive the same vibrations anymore
and when we hear each other speak our names
we don't hear the ringing and the singing of a million bells
perhaps our hearing's failing us perhaps we're hearing other things but who can tell
it could be said that way it could be said that way
but I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
what's the point in making leaving any harder than a leaving really ought to be
[verse 2]
and this road on which I travel paved with broken glass and gravel
has just room for me I hope there's room for me
i suspect that I'll be lonely but I know that if I'm lonely I'll deserve to be
and I plan to think about you just as often as I will and that's my plans for me
it could be said that way it could be said that way
but I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
what's the use in making rhymes I'd much rather say it's time for me to go
so you think you're a cowboy but you're only a kid
with a mind to do everything wrong
and it starts to get smoother when the circle begins
but by the time that you get there it's gone
so you think you're a winner but you're losing again
the cards are all lucky but then
and the hand that you're holding means nothing at all
just knowing is all that is there
so you think you're a cowboy
so your life is a fun the best that you can tomorrow is not right or wrong
and don't wait for tomorrow to bring you your dreams
cause by the time that they get there they're gone
so you think you're a cowboy
yeah but by the time that you get there it's gone
slowly I'm falling more in love with you
and slowly you're winning a heart that can be true
now I can't hide my feelings no matter what I do
for slowly I'm falling more in love with you
more and more I need you and want you by my side
more and more I love you as each day passes by
my heart I know you're stealing I hope that you'll be true
for slowly I'm falling more in love with you
slowly I'm falling
i am a pilgrim and a stranger
traveling through this wearisome land
and I've got a home in that yonder city good lord
and it's not good lordy it's not not made by hand
i got a mother a sister and a brother
who have gone to that sweet home
and I am determined to go and see them good lord
over on good lordy over on that distant shore
as I go down to that river jordan
just to bathe my weary soul
if I could touch but just the hem of his garment good lord
i believe good lordy I believe that it would make me whole
now when I'm dead laying in my coffin
all of my friends all gather round
they can say that he's just laying there sleeping good lord
sweet peace lordy sweet peace his soul is found
we've been sweethearts for so long
but now you say we're through
the love we shared is now a memory
i have built a ship of dreams
and planned them all for you
but now I guess what is to be will be
i'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
drifting out across the ocean blue
yes I'll sail my ship alone though all the sails you've torn
and when it starts to sinkin' I'll blame you
now I gave a message to the wind
to take back home to you
hoping you would hear my s o s
i thought that you would come back home
my darlin' if you knew
how much my achin' heart was in distress
well I'll sail my ship alone with all the dreams I own
drifting out across the ocean blue
yes I'll sail my ship alone though all the sails you've torn
and when it starts to sinkin' I'll blame you
let's pretend we're strangers for tonight
let's pretend we've never hurt each other
if you'll pretend I never made you cry
then I'll pretend you didn't find another
let's pretend our love is just beginning
make believe that it was true love at first sight
and even though my love has never really ended
let's pretend we're strangers for tonight
let's pretend our love is just beginning
make believe that it was true love at first sight
and even though my love has never really ended
let's pretend we're strangers for tonight
[verse 1]
please come to boston for the springtime
i'm staying here with some friends and they've got lots of room
and you can sell your paintings on the sidewalk
by a cafe where I hope to be working soon
please come to boston but she said "no would you come home to me"
and she said "rambling boy why don't you settle down
boston isn't your kind of town
there's no gold and there's nobody like me
i'm the number one fan of the man from tennessee"
[verse 2]
please come to denver with the snowfall
we'll move up into the mountains so far we can't be found
and throw "i love you" echoes down the canyon
and then lie awake at night until they come back around
please come to denver she said "no would you come home to me"
and she said "rambling boy why don't you settle down
boston isn't your kind of town
there's no gold and there's nobody like me
i'm the number one fan of the man from tennessee"
now this drifter's world goes round and round
and I doubt if it's ever going to stop
but of all the dreams I've lost or found and all that I haven't got
i still need to lean to somebody I can sing to
[verse 3]
please come to la to live forever
california life alone is just too hard to build
i live in a house that looks out over the ocean
and there's some stars that fell from the sky living up on the hill
please come to la but she said "no would you come home to me"
and she said "rambling boy why don't you settle down
boston isn't your kind of town
there's no gold and there's nobody like me
i'm the number one fan of the man from tennessee"
i'm looking for that lonely street
i've got a sad sad tale to tell
i need a place to go and weep
where's this place called lonely street
[chorus 1]
a place where there's just loneliness
where dim lights bring forgetfulness
where broken dreams and memories meet
where's this place called lonely street
[chorus 2]
perhaps upon that lonely street
there's someone such as i
who came to bury broken dreams
and watch an old love die
[chorus 1]
if I could find that lonely street
where dim lights bring forgetfulness
broken dreams and mem'ries meet
where's this place called lonely street
[chorus 2]
perhaps upon that lonely street
there's someone such as i
who came to bury broken dreams
and watch an old love die
[chorus 1]
if I could find that lonely street
where dim lights bring forgetfulness
broken dreams and mem'ries meet
where's this place called lonely street
[chorus 1]
you're not a dream you're not an angel you're a woman
i'm not a king I'm a man take my hand
we'll make a space in the lives that we planned
and here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
[verse 1]
yes we're different worlds apart we're not the same
we laughed and played at the stars like in a game
you could have stayed outside my heart but in you came
and here you'll stay until it's time for you to go
[chorus 2]
don't ask why
don't ask how
don't ask forever
love me now
[verse 2]
this love of mine had no beginning it has no end
i was an oak now I'm a willow now I can bend
and though I'll never in my life see you again
still I'll stay until it's time for you to go
[chorus 2]
don't ask why
don't ask how
don't ask forever
love me now
[chorus 1]
you're not a dream you're not an angel you're a woman
i'm not a king I'm a man take my hand
we'll make a space in the lives that we planned
and here we'll stay until it's time for you to go
what a merry christmas this could be
if you would just come back to me
and say that you've forgiven me
what a merry christmas this could be
[verse 1]
it was just last christmas that we quarreled and you walked out
i knew that I was wrong but you'd come back I had no doubt
now a year has rolled around and it's christmas once again
what I'd give if you'd come walking in
what a merry christmas this could be
if you would just come back to me
and say that you've forgiven me
what a merry christmas this could be
when the evenin' sun goes down
you will find me hangin' 'round
the night life ain't no good life but it's my life
many people just like me
dreamin' of old used-to-be's
and the night life ain't no good life but it's my life
listen to the blues they're playin'
listen to what the blues are sayin'
mine is just another scene
from the world of broken dreams
and the night life ain't no good life but it's my life
the night life ain't no good life but it's my life
night and you
and blue hawaii
the night is heavenly
and you are heaven to me
lovely you
and blue hawaii
with all this loveliness
there should be love
come with me
while the moon is on the sea
the night is young
and so are we so are we
dreams come true
in blue hawaii
and mine could all come true
this magic night of nights with you
somewhere in texas
a young cowboy dreams of the days
of the days the buffalo roamed
and he wished he had lived then
'cause he knew that he could have been
the best cowboy the world had ever known
he went dancing that night
with a san antone rose
the one he would marry someday
to the music of bob wills
and polkas and waltzes
while beautiful time passed away
you better watch out
you better not cry
better not pout
i'm telling you why
santa claus is coming to town
he's making a list
and checking it twice
going to find out who's naughty and nice
santa claus is coming to town
he sees you when you're sleeping
he knows when you're awake
he knows if you've been bad or good
so be good for goodness sake
o you better watch out
you better not cry
better not pout I'm telling you why
santa claus is coming to town
santa claus is coming to town
[chorus 1]
always late with your kisses
[verse 1]
won't you come to my arms
sweet darling and stay
[chorus 1][x3]
there will be no teardrops tonight
[verse 1]
i'll pretend I'm free from sorrow
and I make believe that wrong is right
your wedding day will be tomorrow
but there ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight
[verse 2]
and I'll believe that you still love me
when you wear your veil of white
but if you think that you're above me
there ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight
[verse 3]
shame oh shame shame oh shame for what you're doing
others arms others arms will hold you tight
and you don't care whose life you ruin
but there ain't gonna be no teardrops tonight
and there'll be no teardrops tonight
tell me why baby why baby why baby why
you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry
can't help but love you till the day that I die
so tell me why baby why baby why baby why
[verse 1]
i got a crow I want to pick with you
just like last time when the feathers flew
you're running wild kicking up your heels
and leaving me home with a handful of bills
[verse 2]
well I can't iive without you and you know it's true
but there's no living with you so what'll I do
i'm going honky tonkin' get as tight as I can
and maybe by the end you'll appreciate a good man
tell me why baby why baby why baby why
you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry
can't help but love you till the day that I die
so tell me why baby why baby why baby why
[verse 3]
well now I don't know but I've heard say
that every little dog's is gonna have his day
you better pay attention don't you dare forget
cause I'm just a little bitty puppy yet
[verse 4]
i caught you honky tonkin' with my best friend
the thing to do was leave you but I shoulda left him
now I'm too old to leave you but I still get sore
when you come home feeling for the knob on the door
tell me why baby why baby why baby why
you make me cry baby cry baby cry baby cry
can't help but love you till the day that I die
so tell me why baby why baby why baby why
why baby why baby why baby why
it's good to see that I can cry again
now I return to life and live again
as the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man
i'm glad to say that I can cry again
so long my pride would not let my tears to fall
i walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all
as the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man
i'm glad to say that I can cry again
so long my pride would not let my tears to fall
i walk walk to burning hell and never cry at all
as the teardrops wash the heartaches from a man
it's good to know that I can cry again
i'm glad to say that I can cry again
if you really loved me
you wouldn't treat me this way
and you'd be kind enough
to leave some life while I'm away
and I might cry when you go
but I won't die when you go
and someday someone just might come along
if you really loved me
you wouldn't test me this way
you wouldn't leave the choice of leaving up to me
but I'm too proud to survive
because I'm more dead than alive
because someday someone just might come along
tonight down here in the valley
i'm lonesome and oh how I feel
as I sit here alone in my cabin
i can see your mansion on the hill
do you recall when we parted
the story to me you revealed
you said you could live without love dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill
i've waited all through the years love
to give you a heart true and real
'cause I know that you're living in sorrow
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the light shines bright from your window
and the trees stand so silent and still
i know you're alone with your pride dear
in your loveless mansion on the hill
in your loveless mansion on the hill
the sense to see and I saw you walk away
the sense to feel and I feel lonely everyday
the sense to hear for I heard you say goodbye
the sense to taste now I can taste the tears that I cry
my senses tell me all that I need to know
it's over but I don't have the sense to let you go
it doesn't make much sense for me to cry for you
and if I had any sense at all I'd realize we're through
but my senses are reacting much too slow
and it's over but I don't have the sense to let you go
yes it's over but I don't have the sense to let you go
it's a sin my darling how I love you although I know our love can never be
it's a sin to keep this memory of you when silence proves that you've forgotten me
the dreams I built for us have tumbled each promise broken like my heart
why pretend that I can't live without you when deep inside I know that it's a sin
i hope you're happy with another who shares the dream I could not win
some people are saying that time will take care of people like me
that I'm livin' too fast and they say I can't last much longer
but little they see that their thoughts of me is my saviour
and little they know that the beat oughta go a little faster
so pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
the singer ain't singin' and the drummer's been draggin' too long
time'll take care of itself so just leave time alone
and pick up the tempo just a little and take it on home
well I'm wild and I'm mean I'm creatin' a scene I'm goin' crazy
i'm good and I'm bad and I'm happy and sad and I'm lazy
i'm quiet and I'm loud and I'm gatehrin' a crowd and I like gravy
about half off the wall but I learned it all in the navy
so pick up the tempo
take it on home
that's my favorite part rewind my life on
when my world got dark and you turned my light on
i watched it for hours again and again in my head
i did
i see I was down on you more than I needed to be
i'd say I'm sorry but then you'd think I'm lyin'
maria shut up and kiss me
stop shakin' stand up and hold me
i bet you're gonna miss me you need me believe me
maria shut up and kiss me
you're crazy and it turns me on and on
the way you're carryin' on
that's my favorite shirt you always had on
man it sure looked good ev'ry time you walked on
you're takin' the wind from me every chance that you could
you're good
somethin' I can't explain
you tell me lately I've changed
if you feel better tell me why are you cryin'
repeat chorus
maria maria can we talk it over instead
let's call it even and leave it alone
come to bed
maria stop leavin' your teasin' is beaten me down
maria just calm down
in these situations I've found it's best not to be proud
and say that you're sorry
maria shut up and kiss me
stop shakin' stand up and hold me
i bet you're gonna miss me you need me believe me
maria shut up and kiss me
you're crazy and it turns me on and on
the way you're carryin' on
and it turns me on and on
on and on
on and on
and it turns me on and on
on and on
on and on
on and on and on and on
[verse 1]
joy to the world the lord is come
let earth receive her king
let every heart
prepare him room
and saints and angels sing
and saints and angels sing
and saints and saints and angels sing
joy to the world the saviour reigns
let saints their songs employ
while fields and floods
rocks hills and plains
repeat the sounding joy
repeat the sounding joy
repeat repeat the sounding joy
joy to the world with truth and grace
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
and wonders of his love
and wonders of his love
and wonders and wonders of his love
[verse 2]
no more will sin and sorrow grow
nor thorns infest the ground
he'll come and make the blessings flow
far as the curse was found
far as the curse was found
far as far as the curse was found
joy to the world with truth and grace
and makes the nations prove
the glories of his righteousness
and wonders of his love
and wonders of his love
and wonders and wonders of his love
rejoice rejoice in the most high
while israel spreads abroad
like stars that glitter in the sky
and ever worship god
and ever worship god
and ever and ever worship god
[verse 1]
pay no mind to her she only wants to play
but she's not for you she's not for you
and I'm the only one who would let her act this way
but she's not for you she's not for you
[verse 2]
so she told you she found heaven in your eyes
well I think it only fair to warn you that sometimes she lies
but it's your heart I can't tell you what to do
but she's not for you she's not for you
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
she just looks for greener pastures now and then
and when she grows tired she knows old faithful will just take her back again
so just leave her here I'm used to feeling blue
but she's not for you she's not for you
i can't give you anything but love baby
that's the only thing I've plenty of baby
dream a while scheme a while
we're sure to find
happiness and I guess
all those things you've always pined for
gee I like to see you looking' swell baby
diamond bracelets woolworth doesn't sell baby
till that lucky day you know darn well baby
i can't give you anything but love
tomorrow night you'll have another sweetheart
tomorrow night you'll have somebody new
i'm a fool to think your indiscreet heart
could ever love someone with love that's true
you love me in your mind and not your heart dear
and you'll change your mind tomorrow night
loving me is just a passing fancy
another love you'll have tomorrow night
last night I held your hand beneath the table
you said that you already had a date
but you said tomorrow night you might be able
to keep this rendezvous with me a eight
tonight we are together but I know dear
another's arms assure to hold you tight
for I see you smiling at another
another love you'll have tomorrow night
i ran all the way home from baltimore
to beg you to forgive me just once more
the way I've treated you I know you shouldn't let me stay
i guess I drank our precious love away
i guess I drank away the only love and life worthwhile
but you know when I'm sober being mean just ain't my style
i'm so sorry baby I don't know what else to say
i guess I drank our precious love away
we were getting closer than we ever dreamed
and then I let bottle come between
i knew I'd finally gone too far the night I heard you say
"you fool you drank our precious love away"
but if you give me one more chance it won't be like the past
you've seen me take a million but you've seen me take my last
and with your help tomorrow I'll be stronger than today
don't let me drink our precious love away
don't let me drink our precious love away
[verse 1]
i can see indifference is the sign of the times
seems to me compassion's gettin' harder to find
but if everyone would help just one and that one helps another one along
like a fire that's burning low every log would make it grow so pass it on
pass it on to a brother who may need a helping hand
pass it on to a sister it may give her strength to stand
love and kindness make a flame known by many different names
so pass it on pass it on pass it on
[verse 2]
people say I'd like to help but I can't get involved
and anyway I've got problems of my own I haven't solved
someday when we learn that no-one's strong enough to make it on their own
i just hope there's someone there who will take the time to care and pass it on
pass it on to a brother who may need a helping hand
pass it on to a sister it may give her strength to stand
love and kindness make a flame known by many different names
so pass it on pass it on pass it on
pass it on pass it on pass it on
you told me once you were mine alone forever
an' I was yours till the end of eternity
but all those vows are broken now an' I will never
be the same except in memory
remember me when the candle lights are gleamin'
remember me at the close of a long long day
an' it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreamin'
just to know you still remember me
a brighter face may take my place when we're apart dear
another love with a heart more bold and free
but in the end fair weather friends may break your heart dear
an' if they do sweetheart remember me
remember me when the candle lights are gleamin'
remember me at the close of a long long day
an' it would be so sweet when all alone I'm dreamin'
just to know you still remember me
just to know you still remember me
[verse 1]
if I'd have been all you ever wanted
i wonder how much better I'd be
and I know you think it's over
'cause you're so far away
but darlin' you're still here with me
and I will hold you always
no matter how far we're apart
you could be anywhere in the world tonight
but I'd still have you here in my heart
[verse 2]
i don't try to forget you I don't cry over regrets
and I always know right where you are
so I'll be happy just to hold you here in my heart
'til I have you back in my arms
and I will hold you always
no matter how far we're apart
you could be anywhere in the world tonight
i'd still have you here in my heart
you could be anywhere in the world tonight
i'd still have you here in my heart
[verse 1]
i've always been wild the one always jumpin' the gun
even through all the pain I had to stay on the run
you only live once has always been my life's degree
never give all the choice I had to march to that drummer in me
even when I was young the writing was there on he wall
i feared if I dance to his tunes the fiddler would fall
and wouldn't you know that's just how it turned out to be
never give all the choice I had to march o that drummer in me
me and the drummer seems like we're always alone
me and the drummer we dance a whole different song
with or without you the feelin' will always be strong
with or without you me and the drummer move on
[verse 2]
the loves of my life they all think I'm heartless and cold
with no way to know I love them down to my soul
god grant me one wish I know just what it would be
if they call all understand and forgive that old drummer and me
me and the drummer seems like we're always alone
me and the drummer we dance a whole different song
with or without you the feelin' will always be strong
with or without you me and the drummer move on
with or without you me and the drummer move on
on my way to italy from the gulf of mexico
riding on a tanker feeling mighty low
my good gal's behind me no loving for so long
i'm going back to texas for that's where I belong
[verse 1]
nights are so lonely on the ocean
to much time to dream of yesterday
if only I could carry out my notion
and hit the trail for texas right away
[verse 2]
i never thought I was leaving
i could get so blue out on the sea
but I'll bet you after all this grieving
its that good old texas soil for me
[verse 1]
night and day you are the one
only you beneath the moon are under the sun
whether near to me or far
it's no matter of where you are
i think of you day and night
night and day why is it so
that this long for you follows wherever I go
[verse 2]
in that roarin' traffic boom
in silence on my lonely room
i think of you day and night
night and day
under the hide of me
there's an oh such a hungry
yearnin' and burnin' inside of me
and its torment won't be through
'til you let me spend my life makin' love to you
day and night night and day
night and day under the hide of me
there's an oh such a hungry
yearnin' and burnin' inside me
and its torment won't be through
'til you let me spend my life makin' love to you
day and night night and day
night and day
if your sweetheart sends a letter of goodbye
it's no secret you feel better if you cry
when waking from a bad dream don't you sometimes think it's real
but it's only false emotions that you feel
if your heartaches seem to hang around too long
and your blues keep getting bluer with each song
remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky
so let your head down and go on and cry
if your heartaches seem to hang around too long
and your blues keep getting bluer with each song
remember sunshine can be found behind the cloudy sky
so let your head down and go on and cry
there shall be showers of blessing
this is the promise of love
there shall be seasons refreshing
sent from the saviour above
showers of blessing
showers of blessing we need
mercy drops round us are falling
but for the showers we plead
there shall be showers of blessing
precious reviving again
over the hills and the valleys
sound of abundance of rain
showers of blessing
showers of blessing we need
mercy drops round us are falling
but for the showers we plead
there shall be showers of blessing
send them upon us o lord
grant to us now a refreshing
come and now honor thy word
showers of blessing
showers of blessing we need
mercy drops round us are falling
but for the showers we plead
there shall be showers of blessing
oh that today they might fall
now as to god we're confessing
now as on jesus we call
showers of blessing
showers of blessing we need
mercy drops round us are falling
but for the showers we plead
it'll come to me just like a song
and i’ll make it up as I go along
push and pull the give and take
it'll even out for goodness sake
the sun might shine or the wind might blow
i can't say ’cause I don't know
whatever it is it's meant to be
sooner or later it'll come to me
[verse 1]
i've spent so many yesterdays worried about forever
but no amount of worry made the day go any better
and no amount of plannin' made a difference worth a dime
whatever's gonna happen is gonna takes it's own sweet time
it’ll come to me just like a song
and i’ll make it up as I go along
push and pull the give and take
it'll even out for goodness sake
the sun might shine or the wind might blow
i can’t say 'cause I don't know
whatever it is it's meant to be
sooner or later it’ll come to me
[verse 2]
some folks say the end is near and others say it's far
some folks say it's written and the cards are in the stars
but who am I to disagree who know's who's right or wrong
as long as I'm alive I'm leavin' [] alone
it'll come to me just like a song
and I'll make it up as I go along
push and pull the give and take
it'll even out for goodness sake
the sun might shine or the wind might blow
i can't say 'cause I don't know
whatever it is it's meant to be
sooner or later it'll come to me
so swing your partner doce-doe
the future is not ours to know
hold her tight and promenade
tomorrow is another day
and it'll come to me just like a song
and I'll make it up as I go along
push and pull the give and take
it'll even out for goodness sake
the sun might shine or the wind might blow
i can't say 'cause I don't know
whatever it is it's meant to be
sooner or later it'll come to me
whatever it is that's meant to be
sooner or later it'll come to me
[verse 1]
i don't really want your bed just a place to lay my head
as I contemplate the struggle way of life
i don' want your vintage wine just a moment of your time
and a crumb or two from the stalf of life
[verse 2]
now the stalf of life for me is in your good company
well I'll share a few short moments with you
let us talk about some things let us make the music ring
while we're not yet old enough to know the truth
[verse 3]
well the truth cannot be found as long as we are bound
to be blinded from the moment of our birth
so the answer my friend must lie from within
so this immigration from this place called earth
[verse 4]
in the metaphysic world you'll find the answer furled
never to be pried by human hands
so you must await the sign or the truth will come in time
unfurling like the flowers in the sand
[verse 5]
now I am outside the sphere of the influenced ear
as I look around for a brothers soul
but if honesty transcends all the loose and danglin' ends
then the finding of that rubber is my goal
[verse 6]
if you're on the left or right you're still in for the fight
that's one thing that'll have to popularize
if it's the middle you are in you will always be my friend
just as long as you never compromise
and if you think my thoughts are crude
then I'll try not to be too rude
after all you are free to criticize
but if you think you should refine
vinegar from vintage wine
then the grapes of [] will curse you all your life
and we could sit here all the night
tryna make the wrong to right
but this isn't my philosophy
for I'm thinkin' all the while I'd much rather see your smile
which is truth in all it's immediacy
which is truth in all it's immediacy
[verse 1]
nobody cares about me
ain't even got a friend
baby's gone and left me
when will my troubles end
black night is fallin'
oh how I hate to be alone
i keep crying for my baby
but now another day is gone
[verse 2]
i've got no one to talk with
to tell my troubles to
don't even know I'm living since I lost you
black night is fallin'
oh how I hate to be alone
i keep crying for my baby
but now another day is gone
[verse 3]
my mother has her troubles
my father has his too
my brother's in korea
and I don't know just what to do
black night black night is fallin'
oh how I hate to be alone
i keep crying for my baby
but now another day is gone
[verse 1]
what was it you wanted
tell me again so i’ll know
what’s happening in there
what’s going on in your show
what was it you wanted
could you say it again
i’ll be back in a minute
you can get it together by then
[verse 2]
what was it you wanted
you can tell me i’m back
we can start it all over
and get it back on the track
you got my attention
go ahead speak
what was it you wanted
when you were kissing my cheek
[verse 3]
was there somebody looking
when you give me that kiss
someone there in the shadows
someone that I might have missed
is there something you needed
something I don’t understand
what was it you wanted
do I have it here in my hand
[verse 4]
whatever you wanted
slipped out of my mind
would you remind me again
would you be so kind
has the record been breaking
and did the needle just skip
is there somebody waiting
was there a slip of the lip
[verse 5]
what was it you wanted
i ain’t keeping score
are you the same person
that was here before
is it something important
maybe not
what was it you wanted
tell me again I forgot
[verse 6]
whatever you wanted
what could it be
did somebody tell you
that you could get it from me
is it something that comes natural
and is it easy to say
what was it you wanted
and who are you anyway
[verse 7]
is the scenery changing
and am I getting it wrong
is the whole thing going backwards
are they playing our song
where were you when it started
do you want it for free
what was it you wanted
are you talking to me

well sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
sometimes I don't even know
sometimes I take it as far as I can
and sometimes I don't even go
my front tracks're found for a cold water
and my back tracks're covered with snow
sometimes it's heaven sometimes it's hell
sometimes I don't even know
heaven ain't walkin' on a street paved with gold
and hell ain't a mountain of fire
heaven is layin' in my sweet baby's arms
hell is when baby ain't there
my front tracks're found for a cold water
and my back tracks're covered with snow
sometimes it's heaven sometimes it's hell
sometimes I don't even know
well sometimes it's heaven and sometimes it's hell
sometimes I don't even know
last night was a one night love affair
i can’t get through my head
that you don’t feel the same way I do
you never heard a word I said
like hold me close and don’t turn me loose again
and this night ain’t gonna end
you were looking for a lover
i was looking for a friend
but I won’t hurt I won’t cry no more
i won’t even ask you why
it never fails it always gives the same
hello love goodbye
goodbye my love I hope I see you soon
follow the sun and find your dream
i wanna say that it’s been lots of fun
i wanna say the words I mean
like hold me close and don’t turn me loose again
this night ain’t gonna end
you were looking for a lover
i was looking for a friend
but I won’t hurt I won’t cry no more
i won’t even ask you why
it never fails it always gives the same
hello love goodbye
hello love goodbye
hello love goodbye
the chimes of time ring out the news another day is through
someone slipped and fell was that someone you
you may have longed for added strength your courage to renew
do not be disheartened for I have news for you
it is no secret what god can do
what he's done for others he’ll do for you
with arms wide open he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do
there is no night for in his light you never walk alone
always feel at home wherever you may roam
there is no power can conquer you while god is on your side
take him at his promise don't run away and hide
it is no secret what god can do
what he’s done for others he'll do for you
with arms wide open he'll pardon you
it is no secret what god can do
[verse 1]
love was such an easy game to play
now I need a place to hide away
oh i believe in yesterday
[chorus 1]
this looks like a december day
this looks like a "time to remember" day
and I remember the spring such a sweet tender thing
and love's summer college
where the green leaves of knowledge
were waiting to fall with the fall
[verse 1]
and where september wine
numbed a measure of time
through the tears of october now november's over
and this looks like a december day
[chorus 2]
this looks like a december day
it looks like we've come to the end of the way
and as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
the ending that won't go away
[verse 2]
and as my memories race back to love's eager beginning
reluctant to play with the thoughts of the ending
the ending that won't go away
and this looks like a december day

you decide what you need
and then you let me know
i'll be waiting here until you call
[verse 2]
take your time until you find
which way your heart must go
and when you decide let me know
don't you worry if you see me cry
i would rather have you say goodbye
than to be the one that you say you love
if I'm can't be the one that you're dreaming of
[verse 3]
you decide what you want
and I'll be waiting here
you already know how much I care
you decide and we'll just go from there
don't you worry if you see me cry
i would rather have you say goodbye
than to be the one that you say you love
if I'm can't be the one that you're dreaming of
[verse 3]
you decide what you want
and I'll be waiting here
you already know how much I care
you decide and we'll just go from there
you decide and we'll just go from there
you went away and left me a long time ago
now you've come back knockin' on my door
i hear you knockin' but you can't come in
i hear you knockin' go back where you've been
i begged you not to go but you said goodbye
now you come back tellin' all those lies
i hear you knockin' but you can't come in
i hear you knockin' go back where you've been
and if you had listened a long time ago
you wouldn't be goin' from door to door
i hear you knockin' but you can't come in
i hear you knockin' go back where you've been
when you find another's arms around you
do you ever think of me
when you whisper "i can't live without you"
do you ever think of me
and when your eyes disguise
the same old loving lies you tell so tenderly
and in your heart unfeeling
when some heart you're stealing
do you ever think of me
when you find another's arms around you
do you ever think of me
when you whisper "i can't live without you"
do you ever think of me
and when your eyes disguise
the same old loving lies you tell so tenderly
and in your heart unfeeling
when some heart you're stealing
do you ever think of me
hello walls
how'd things go for you today
don't you miss her
since she up and walked away
and I'll bet you dread to spend
another lonely night with me
but lonely walls I'll keep you company
hello window
well I see that you're still here
aren't you lonely
since our darlin' disappeared
well look here is that a teardrop
in the corner of your pane
now don't you try to tell me that's it's rain
she went away and left us all alone
the way she planned
guess we'll have to learn to get along
without her if we can
hello ceiling
i'm gonna stare at you a while
you know I can't sleep
so won't you bear with me a while
we must all stick together
or else I'll lose my mind
i gotta feelin' she'll be gone
a long long time
please don't think it's your fault 'cause I'm cryin'
but every now and then a memory calls
for long ago this heart of mine was broken
and it takes a while for all the tears to fall
these tears I'm cryin'
are teardrops that I cried so long ago
they're just now falling
i made-believe I never really loved you
pretended that I didn't care at all
then suddenly the truth crashed down upon me
and my anxious tears could hardly wait to fall
these tears I'm cryin'
are teardrops that I cried so long ago
they're just now falling
there's gonna be love love love in my house tonight
[verse 1]
yes there's gonna be love in my house tonight
'cause the one that I love is coming home tonight
and this stack of lumber brick and glass will come to life again at last
'cause there's gonna be love in my house tonight
[verse 2]
a welcome mat will tell the world that trouble comes no further
the shingles on the roof will snuggle closer to each other
the houses up and down the street will marvel at the sight
'cause there's gonna be love in my house tonight
[instrumental break]
there's gonna be love love love in my house tonight
[verse 3]
the mirrors on the walls will smile at everyone who sees them
as the carpets hug the floors and do their best to try to please them
happiness will fill each room and prove that all is right
'cause there's gonna be love in my house tonight
[verse 1]
the first noel
the angels did say
was to certain
poor shepherds
in fields as they lay
in fields where they may
keeping their sheep
on a cold winter's night
that was so deep
noel noel noel noel

[verse 2]
they looked up
and saw a star
shining in the east
beyond them far
and to the earth
it gave great light
and so it continued
both day and night
noel noel noel noel
is the king of israel
[verse 3]
then entered
in those wise men three
full reverently
upon their knee
and offered there
in his presence
their gold and myrrh
and frankincense

is the king of israel

try to think that love's not around
but it's uncomfortably near
my poor heart ain't gaining no ground
'cause my angel eyes ain't here
[verse 2 willie nelson]
angel eyes that old devil's scent
they glow unbearably bright
need I say my love is misspent
on angel eyes tonight
[chorus ray charles]
so drink up all you people
order anything you see
have fun you happy people
'cause the laughs and the drink's on me
wait a minute willie
pardon me 'cause I gotta run
the fact's uncommonly clear
you know I've gotta find who's now number one
and why my angel eyes ain't here
[chorus willie nelson]

birds flying south
to the one I love
birds flying high and free
don't tell my darling
that you saw me
looking the way you see me
[verse 2]
winds blowing warm
to the one I love
winds please kiss her for me
but don't tell my darling
that you saw me
looking the way you see me
the way you see me
is how I've been
and have ever since she's been gone
just tell her you saw me
like I'd like to be
and tell her I'm happy alone
[verse 3]
river of tears
that I have cried
river flow on to the sea
but don't tell my darling
that you flowed from my eyes
or she'll see me the way you see me

each night I laid there in prison
i pictured a future so bright
for he was the one ray of sunshine
that shone through the darkest of nights
my son calls another man daddy
he'll never know my name nor my face
god only knows how it hurts me
for another to be in my place
each night I laid there in prison
i pictured a future so bright
for he was the one ray of sunshine
that shone through the darkest of nights
today his mother shares a new love
she just couldn't stand my disgrace
mu son calls another man daddy
and longs for the love he can't replace
my son calls another man daddy
he'll never know my name nor my face
god only knows how it hurts me
for another to be in my place
[verse 1]
don't say love or nothing atleast not for a while
give me a chance to try and catch my heart
my heart is scared to pieces and it’s run ten thousand miles
so don't say love don't say love or nothing for a while
[verse 2]
yesterday is still too fresh now on my mind
perhaps my heart will learn to show its face again in time
so speak to me of fashions and clothes that are in style
but don’t say love don't say love or nothing for a while
[verse 2]
yesterday is still too fresh now on my mind
perhaps my heart will learn to show its face again in time
so speak to me of fashions and clothes that are in style
but don't say love don't say love or nothing for a while
we finally said all our final goodbyes
and tear after tear fell from everyone's eyes
but just like a funeral where nobody dies
there's worse things than being alone
there are worse things than being alone
like a full house and nobody home
if the feeling keeps changing then somethings gone wrong
and there's worse things than being alone
well past my half-way in time
but I still have a lot on my mind
and there's one thing for certain beyond right or wrong
there's worse things than being alone
there are worse things than being alone
like a full house and nobody home
if the feeling keeps changing then somethings gone wrong
and there's worse things than being alone
if a feeling keeps changing then somethings one wrong
and there's worse things than being alone
if you're feeling salty i’m your tequila
if you've got the freedom well I've got the time
there ain’t nothin' sweeter than naked emotions
so you show me yours fun and I'll show you mine
no ma'am I know this ain't all that you've ever been used to
you with your rings of your fingers and time on your hands
sometimes it's nice to have somebody nice to be close to
god knows I've been there before you and I understand
if you’re feeling salty i’m your tequila
if you've got the freedom well i’ve got the time
there ain't nothin' sweeter than naked emotions
so you show me yours fun and I'll show you mine
i wish that I were the answer to all of your questions
lord knows I know you wish you were the answer to mine
so darlin’ if you ain't got a thing but a change of direction
lord knows I know you'll be something I'm lucky to find
if you're feeling salty I'm your tequila
if you've got the freedom well I've got the time
there ain't nothin' sweeter than naked emotions
so you show me yours fun and I'll show you mine

the morning that you left me was just another day
how could I see the sorrow that had found me
and then you left and told me that I was in your way
and I turned and ran as heaven fell around me
[verse 2]
i stumbled through the darkness my footsteps were unsure
i live within a world that had no sunshine
but when you left me darling my world came to an end
and there was darkness on the face of the earth
and the stars fell out of heaven the moon could not be found
the sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
why did you ever leave me you knew how it would hurt
and now there's darkness on the face of the earth
[instrumental break]

cry cry darlin' that's what I'll do
if you should leave me with the blues
cry cry darlin' that's all i do
'cause you're the one that's in my heart
for me there'll be no moonlight
if ever we should part
cry cry darlin' that's all I do
'cause you're the one that's in my heart
cry cry darlin' my eyes will cry
and never dry if you should go
cry cry darlin' when shadows creep
i'll just weep all night I know
you know how much I'd miss you
if ever we should part

'cause you're the one that's in my heart

you keep saying you love him and I believe that it's true
and it just doesn't matter how much I love you
but at time you'll understand dear when you shed a tear
you'll know that you were livin' in your tender years
[verse 2]
in your eyes there's a love life that's shinin' for him
but now long will it stay there will that love life grow dim
you can just see the happiness you can't see the tears
it's true 'cause you're livin' in your tender years
[verse 3]
so if I can' be your first love then I'll wait and be your last
i'll be somewhere in the future to help you forget the past
and you'll know that I love you with a love that's sincere
'cause I'll wait 'til you're through livin' in your tender years
and you'll know that I love you with a love that's sincere
i'll wait 'il you're through livin' in your tender years
the sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
and the sky was never blue
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
and I never cared for you
i know you won't believe these things I tell you
no you won’t believe
your heart has been forewarned all men will lie to you
and your mind cannot conceive
now all depends on what I say to you
and on your doubting me
so I've prepared these statements far from true
pay heed and disbelieve
the sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all
the sky was never blue
the stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall
and I never cared for you
[instrumental break]

it came upon the midnight clear that glorious song of old
from angels bending near the earth to touch their harps of gold
peace on the earth goodwill to men from heaven's all gracious king
the world in solemn stillness lay to hear the angels sing
[verse 2]
still through the cloven skies they come with peaceful wings unfurl
and still their heavenly music floats o'er all the weary world
above its sad and lowly plains they bend on hovering wing
and ever o'er its babel sounds the blessed angels sing
[verse 3]
oh yeah beneath life's crushing load whose forms are bending low
who toil along the climbing way with painful steps and slow
look now for glad and golden hours come swiftly on the wing
oh rest beside the weary road and hear the angels sing
[verse 4]
for lo the days are hastening on by prophets seen of old
when with the ever circling years shall come the time foretold
when the new heaven and earth shall own the prince of peace their king
and the whole world send back the song which now the angels sing
[verse 1]
i was born when the moon was full and bright
and I've been howlin' ever since that night
i was born for trouble and somebody raised me right
[verse 2]
i learned how to run before I could walk
i knew how to cuss before I could talk
i was born for trouble and somebody raised me right
[verse 3]
everybody said where I come from
i wouldn't live to see 21
i was born for trouble and somebody raised me right
[verse 4]
i whooped a man at the county fair
he couldn't stand the way that I combed my hair
i was born for trouble and somebody must've raised me right
[verse 5]
well I've learned something that I'll never forget
that women like men that they can't get
i was born for trouble born for trouble and somebody raised me right
no tellin' what I'll do or what I'll try
but I gotta keep livin' until I die
i was born for trouble born for trouble and somebody must have raised me right
[verse 1]
no I leave me down to sleep
and if I sleep perhaps I'll dream
and if I dream I'll be with you
in the shelter of your arms
i pray that god will leak tonight
and grant me time before the light
for the light of day will take me from the shelter of your arms
and though I know it's just a dream
a dream that soon must end
the arms I feel I know are real
and I'm happy once again
[verse 2]
and if I die while I'm asleep
i pray my dreams he'll let me keep
and carry me through eternity
in the shelter of your arms
and though I know it's just a dream
a dream that soon must end
the arms I feel I know are real
and I'm happy once again
[verse 2]
and if I die while I'm asleep
i pray my dreams he'll let me keep
and carry me through eternity
in the shelter of your arms

pay no mind to her she only wants to play
but she's not for you she's not for you
and I'm the only one who would let her act this way
but she's not for you she's not for you
[verse 2]
so she told you she found heaven in your eyes
well I think it only fair to warn you that sometimes she lies
but it's your heart I can't tell you what to do
but she's not for you she's not for you
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
she just looks for greener pastures now and then
and when she grows tired she knows old faithful will just take her back again
so just leave her here I'm used to feeling blue
but she's not for you she's not for you
she's not for you she's not for you
when I was seventeen
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for small town girls
and soft summer nights
we'd hide from the lights
on the village green
when I was seventeen
when I was twenty-one
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for city girls
who lived upstairs
with all that perfumed hair
and it came undone
when I was twenty-one
when I was thirty-five
it was a very good year
it was a very good year for blue-blooded girls
of independent means
we'd ride in limousines
their chauffeurs would drive
when I was thirty-five
but now the days grow short
i'm in the autumn of the year
and now I think of my life as vintage wine
from fine old kegs
from the brim to the dregs
and it poured sweet and clear
it was a very good year
it was a very good year
it was a very good year
[verse 1]
i had not planned on seeing you
i was afraid of what I'd do
but pride is strong and here am i
and I just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 2]
what force behind your evil mind
can let your lips speak so unkind
to one who loves as much as i
and I just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 3]
the flesh around your throat is pale
intended by my fingernails
please don't scream please don't cry
'cause I just can't let you say goodbye
[verse 4]
your voice is still it speaks no more
you'll never hurt me anymore
death is a friend to love and i
'cause now you'll never say goodbye
[instrumental break]
[verse 1]
i had not planned on seeing you
i was afraid of what I'd do

it would be a comfort just to know you never doubt me
even though I give you cause most every day
sometimes I think that you'd be better off without me
although I love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 2]
and don't doubt my love if sometimes my mind should wander
to a suddenly remembered yesterday
my mind could never stay too long away from you
and I always love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 3]
and though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
and though my faults may grow in number day by day
let no one ever say that I've ever been untrue
i'll always love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 3]
and though I may not always be the way you'd have me be
and though my faults may grow in number day by day
let no one ever say I've ever been untrue
i'll always love you in my own peculiar way
i'll always love you in my own peculiar way
[verse 1]
i let my mind wonder and what did it do
it just kept right on goin' until it got back to you
i can't trust it one minute it's worse than a child
disobeys without conscious and it's drivin' me wild
when I let my mind wonder
i try to keep my mind busy
with thoughts of today
but invariably memories seem to lure it away
[verse 2]
my lonely heart wonders if there'll ever come a day
when I can be happy but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wonder
i try to keep my mind busy
with thoughts of today
but invariably memories seem to lure it away
[verse 2]
my lonely heart wonders if there'll ever ever come a day
a day when I can be happy but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wonder I let my mind wonder
i let my mind wonder
if I have wounded any soul today
if I have caused one foot to go astray
if I have walked in my own willful way
dear lord forgive
o come all ye faithful joyful and triumphant
o come ye o come ye to bethlehem
come and behold him
born the king of angels
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
o come let us adore him
christ the lord
fairy tales can come true
it can happen to you
if you're young at heart
for it's hard you will find
to be narrow of mind
if you're young at heart
you can go to extremes
with impossible schemes
you can laugh when your dreams
fall apart at the seams
and life gets more exciting with each passing day
and love is either in your heart or on it's way
don't you know that it's worth
every treasure on earth
to be young at heart
for as rich as you are
it's much better by far
to be young at heart
and if you should survive
to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart
and if you should survive
to a hundred and five
look at all you'll derive
out of being alive
and here is the best part you have a head start
if you are among the very young at heart
wishing on a star might be old-fashioned
you have failed a million times before
but for me it's working to perfection
who could ask for anything more
it's brought us to the days of rockets
through hard times with empty pockets
but now and then stars are known to fall
and I need to know that we're still partners after all
slide over closer to me honey
just like the night I promised you the moon
every time we touch each other
always gets me there so soon
now and then stars are known to fall
and I need to know that we're still partners after all
and I need to know
slide over closer to me honey
just like the night I promised you the moon
every time we touch each other
always gets me there so soon
now and then stars are known to fall
and I need to know that we're still partners after all
after all
[verse 1]
there's a bird in the sky
flyin’ high flyin' high
to a place from a place
changin' skies changin’ skies
[verse 2]
there are clouds in the sky
clouds of fear and dispare
but love like ours never dies
changin' skies changin' skies
[verse 3]
little bird have you heard
freedom lies freedom lies
but love like ours never dies
just changin' skies changin' skies
[verse 1]
misery mansion so cold and so gray
you look so lonely since she went away
misery mansion what secrets you hide
of a love that has faded and died
[verse 2]
misery mansion oh how you've changed
your walls hold the sorrow that loneliness brings
a love of a life time forever is gone
misery mansion my home
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
you know all the reasons why she said goodbye
and you stand there in silence while I sit and cry
misery mansion we're both so alone
misery mansion my home

circles and cycles
phases and stages
and scenes that we've all seen before
let me tell you some more
[verse 2]
washing the dishes
scrubbing the floors
caring for someone who don't care anymore
[verse 3]
learning to hate all the things that she once loved to do
like washing his shirts and never complaining
except of red stains on the collars
ironin' and cryin'
cryin' and ironin'
caring for someone who don't care anymore
[verse 4]
someday she'll just walk away
phases and stages
circles and cycles
and scenes that
we've all seen before
let me tell you some more
[verse 1]
i get the craziest feeling I guess it's 'cause I'm losing you
i don't know what to do I just make the rounds get in jams
i get the craziest feeling I guess I'm gonna lose my mind
but maybe if I lost my mind then maybe I'd learn to forget
and before I was born I never had cares
i won't have cares when I'm gone
but until that day when they take me away
i'll do my best but it's hard to go on
i get the craziest feeling I wish it would leave me alone
but it just goes on and on that crazy feeling you're gone
before I was born I never had cares
i won't have cares when I'm gone
but until that day when they take me away
i'll do my best but it's hard to go on
i get the craziest feeling I wish it would leave me alone
but it just goes on and on that crazy feeling you're gone
o they tell me of a home far beyond the skies
o they tell me of a home far away
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
o the land of cloudless day
o the land of an unclouded day
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
o they tell me of a home where my friends have gone
o they tell me of that land far away
where the tree of life in eternal bloom
sheds its fragrance through the uncloudy day
o the land of cloudless day
o the land of an unclouded day
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
o they tell me of a king in his beauty there
and they tell me that mine eyes shall behold
where he sits on the throne that is whiter than snow
in the city that is made of gold
o the land of cloudless day
o the land of an unclouded day
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
o they tell me that he smiles on his children there
and his smile drives their sorrows all away
and they tell me that no tears ever come again
in that lovely land of uncloudy day
o the land of cloudless day
o the land of an unclouded day
o they tell me of a home where no storm clouds rise
o they tell me of an uncloudy day
if I'd only had one arm to hold her
better yet if I had none at all
then I wouldn't have two arms that ache for you
there'd be one less memory to recall
if I'd only had one ear to listen
oh to the lies that she told to me
then I would more closely resemble
the half a man that she made of me
and if I had been born with but one eye
then I don't leave have one eye to cries
and if half of my heart turned to ashes
maybe half of my heartaches would die
if I'd only had one leg to stand on
then a much truer picture she'd see
for then I more closely resemble
the half a man that she made of me
the half a man that she made of me
[verse 1]
just watched the sunrise on the other side of town
once more I've waited and once more you’ve let me down
this would be a perfect time for me to die
so I'd like to take this opportunity to cry
[verse 2]
you gave your word now I return it to you
with this suggestion as to what you can do
just exchange the words I love you for goodbye
while I take this opportunity to cry
[verse 3]
i'd like to see you but i’m afraid
that I don't know wrong from right
and if I saw you would I kiss you
or want to kill you on sight
[verse 4]
it's been a long night so I think I'll go home
and feed my nightmares they've been waiting all all night long
they'll be the last ones to tell me goodbye
and they'll give me many opportunities to cry
they'll give me many opportunities to cry
i'll take you home again kathleen
across the ocean deep and wide
to where your heart has ever been
since first you were my bonnie bride
the roses all have left your cheek
i’ve watched them fade away and die
your voice is weak whenever you speak
and tears bedim your loving eyes
i will take you home kathleen
to where your heart will know no pain
and when the fields are fresh and green
i will take you to your home kathleen
the roses all have left your cheek
i've watched them fade away and die
your voice is weak whenever you speak
and tears bedim your loving eyes
i will take you home kathleen
to where your heart will know no pain
and when the fields are fresh and green
i will take you home again kathleen
[verse 1]
a long long time ago
and far away
sometimes I journey there
at night and see you there
with me
i ride wile memories
through miles of time
leap over broken dreams
so many broken dreams
all mine all mine
[verse 2]
and then I see you there
holdin' me
and then I look again
and then I see that it's not me
so I turn my memories
and I ride away
back through those bitter tears
so many bitter ears
a []
but when he night is still
i know that I can still
see yesterday
[verse 1 willie nelson]
what is this thing called love
this funny thing called love
who can solve its mystery
why should it make a fool of me
[verse 2 norah jones & willie nelson]
i saw you there one wonderful day
you took my heart and threw it away
that's why I ask the lord up in heaven above
what is this thing called love
[verse 3 norah jones & willie nelson]
i saw you there one wonderful day
you took my heart and threw it away
that's why I ask the lord in heaven above
just what is this thing called love
[verse 1]
i was sitting beside the road in blackjack county
not knowing that the sheriff paid a bounty
for men like me who didn't have a penny to their names
so he locked my leg to thirty-five pounds of blackjack county chains
[verse 2]
all we had to eat was bread and water
and each day we had to build that road a mile and a quarter
and a blacksnake whip would cut our backs when some poor fool complained
but we couldn't fight back wearing thirty-five pounds of blackjack county chains
[instrumental break]
[verse 3]
and then one night while the sheriff was a sleeping
we all gathered 'round him slowly creeping
and heaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain
when we beat him to death with the thirty-five pounds of blackjack county chains
[verse 4]
now the whip marks have all healed and I am thankful
that there's nothing but a scar round my ankle
most of all I'm glad no man will be a slave again
to a blacksnake whip and thirty-five pounds of blackjack county chains blackjack county chains blackjack county chains
was it somethin' I did lord
a lifetime ago
am I just now repayin'
a debt that I owe
justice sweet justice
you travel so slow
but you can't change my love for the rose
[verse 1]
i'll walk alone
where once we wandered
it seems so strange
since you are gone
'til you return
i'll stay the same dear
but while you're gone
i'll walk alone
[verse 2]
by stars above
i swear to love you
with all the love
thati've ever known
no mater where you are out yonder
i'll still be true
and walk alone
i'll still be true
and walk alone
softly and tenderly jesus is calling
calling for you and for me
see on the portals he's waiting and watching
watching for you and for me
come home come home
you who are weary come home
earnestly tenderly jesus is calling
calling oh sinners come home
why should we tarry when jesus is pleading
pleading for you and for me
why should we linger and heed not his mercies
mercies for you and for me
come home come home
you who are weary come home
earnestly tenderly jesus is calling
calling oh sinners come home
time is now fleeting the moments are passing
passing from you and from me
shadows are gathering deathbeds are coming
coming for you and for me
come home come home
you who are weary come home
earnestly tenderly jesus is calling
calling oh sinners come home
thought of the wonderful love he has promised
promised for you and for me
though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon

you who are weary come home
earnestly tenderly jesus is calling
calling oh sinners come home
i let my mind wander
and what did it do
it just kept right on going
until it got back to you
i let my mind wander
can't trust it one minute
it's worse than a child
disobeys without conscience
it's drivin' me wild
when I let my mind wander
try to keep my mind busy
on thoughts of today
but invariably memories
seem to lure it away
my lonely heart wonders
if there'll ever come a day
when I can be happy
but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wander
i try to keep my mind busy
with thoughts of today
but invariably mem'ries
seem to lure it away
my lonely heart wonders
if there'll ever come a day
when I can be happy
but I can't see no way
'cause I let my mind wander
[verse 1]
with reason runnin' slowly through my mind
and logic only with me half the time
how can I be expected to react with any visible signs of sanity
when I don't have you
when I don't have you
[verse 2]
and with loneliness ablaze within' my brain
causing me no small degree of pain
so how can I be expected to react with any visible signs of sanity
when I don't have you
when I don't have you
when I don't have you
[verse 3]
apologize for all the stupid things I do
but realize that foolish eyes don't always see the truth
when they're blinded by the blinding light of pride
i can't look out and I'm afraid to look inside
so how can I be expected to react with any visible signs of sanity
when I don't have you
when I don't have you
when I don't have you

three days that I hate to see arrive
three days that I hate to be alive
three days filled with tears and sorrow
yesterday today and tomorrow
there are three days that I know that I'll be blue
three days that I'll always dream of you
but it does no good to wish these days would end
'cause the same three days start over again
three days that I hate to see arrive
three days that I dread to be alive
three days filled with tears and sorrow
yesterday today and tomorrow

like a bird on the wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free
like a worm on a hook
like a knight from some old fashioned book
i have saved all my ribbons for thee
if I if I have been unkind
i hope that you can just let it go by
if I if I have been untrue
i hope you know it was never to you
like a baby stillborn
like a beast with his horn
i have torn everyone who reached out for me
but I swear by this song
and by all that I have done wrong
i will make it all up to thee
i saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch
he said to me "you must not ask for so much"
and a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door
she cried to me "hey why not ask for more"
oh like a bird on the wire
like a drunk in a midnight choir
i have tried in my way to be free
i love corrina tell the world I do
i love corrina yes tell the world I do

there's been no loving since you've been gone

what used to be my home has changed to just a place to stay
a crumbling last resort when day is through
sometimes between sundown and dawn somehow I find my way
to this home motel on lost love avenue
[verse 2]
no one seems to really care if I come here at all
and the one who seems to care the least is you
i'm gonna hang a neon sign with letters big and blue
home motel on lost love avenue

i never cared much for moonlit skies
i never winked back at fireflies
now that the stars are in your eyes
i'm beginning to see the light
i never went in for afterglow
or candlelight on the mistletoe
but now when you turn the lamp down low
i'm beginning to see the light
i used to ramble through the park
shadow boxing in the dark
then you came and caused the spark
that's a four-alarm fire now
i never made love by lantern shine
i never saw rainbows in my wine
but now that your lips are burning mine
i'm beginning to see the light
i never cared much for moonlit skies
i never winked back at fireflies
now that the stars are in your eyes
i'm beginning to see the light

i want a girl whose heart has been broken
by a love that has passed her by
and I want a girl whose lips have been taken
by lips that have kissed and lied
and I want a girl whose heart has no pain
the the kind I'm feelin’ on
and one who will understand how I feel
one who will not make me cry
and I want a girl whose heart has been broken
just like my darlin' broke mine
[verse 2]

somewhere there's music
how faint the tune
somewhere there’s heaven
how high the moon
there is no moon above
when love is far away too
till it comes true
that you love me as I love you

it's where you are
somewhere there’s heaven
how near how far
the darkest night would shine
if you would come to me soon
until you will how still my heart

you may not be an angel
'cause angels are so few
but until the day that one comes along
i'll string along with you
i'm looking for an angel
to sing my love song to
and until the day that one comes along
i'll sing my song to you
for every little fault that you have
say I've got three or four
the human little faults you do have
just make me love you more
you may not be an angel
but still I'm sure you'll do
so until the day that one comes along

when you were with me I was happy
but you took my happy away
you had to go leave me lonely
and my lonely just won't go away
i told you I told you I'm sorry
my sorry gets bigger each day
with you in my arms I'd be happy
but you took my happy away
[verse 2]
you must know by now how I need you
but you treat my need you so wrong
you must know by now how I love you
so don't wait 'til my love you is gone
i told you I told you I'm sorry
my sorry gets bigger each day
with you in my arms I'd be happy
but you took my happy away
